00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,370
我们要把你送回未来了
We're sending you back to the future!

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,340
为何时间旅行如此有趣
Why is time travel fun?

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,760
开始了
Here we go.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,290
因为有谁会不对过去好奇呢
Because who doesn't wonder about the past?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,660
有谁会不对未来好奇呢
Who doesn't wonder about the future?

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,790
某人从未来回来  改变过去
Somebody comes back from the future to change what happened.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,920
我们是在一部已经拍好的电影里吗
Are we basically in a movie that's already been shot?

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,070
我会回来的
I'll be back.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,230
时间旅行故事接受各种可能性
Time travel stories embrace the potential

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,460
我们可能开启新的时间线  新的世界
that we might open up new timelines, new worlds,

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,190
以及我们人类的新未来
and new possibilities for ourselves as people.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,840
那种能看穿一切的想象
That kind of imagination which can see through everything.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,340
我们讲述关于时间旅行的故事时
What are we always trying to do

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,540
常做的一件事是什么
when we tell stories about time travel?

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,810
我常做的一件事是试图去感动观众
What I'm always trying to do is to touch people

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,560
触及内心
in the heart.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,930
今天  我已经和你当年离开时一样大了
Today, I'm the age you were when you left.

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,580
你现在该回来了吧
This would be a real good tie for you to come back.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,440
如果我们可以随意穿越时间
If we can go any place we want in time,

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,640
时间不再是我们的束缚
time is no longer our jail.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,240
我们是由我们所经历的每一秒塑造而成的
Every second of our past makes us who we are.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,860
而一想到我们可以重新经历一遍
And the idea that we could relive that

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,960
或者从另一个角度看一遍
or view it from another perspective

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,710
这种想法很人性  触及灵魂
is so human, and so spiritual,

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,240
我觉得它能感动所有人
that I think it touches everyone.

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,200

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,640
你基本上算是涵盖了

《回到未来》系列电影
the "Back To The Future" series of films.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,250
你觉得时间旅行是可能的吗
Do you think time travel is possible?

37
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,700
我和埃洛·莫里斯合作的时候
I asked Stephen Hawking that one day,

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,670
问过斯蒂芬·霍金
when I worked with Errol Morris.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
有几个人能有这种经历
How many people get to say that?

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,140
但当时我和埃洛合作
But when I was working with Errol

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,440
作为他的监制  拍摄根据斯蒂芬·霍金的书
as his executive producer on the documentary

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,720
《时间简史》改编的纪录片
on Stephen Hawking's book, "A Brief History of Time."

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
我问了斯蒂芬·霍金那个问题
I asked Stephen Hawking that question

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,300
因为当时《回到未来》刚刚上映
because "Back To The Future" just came out.

45
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,000
而斯蒂芬·霍金回答说穿越到未来很有可能
And Stephen Hawking said it's very possible to go into the future,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,990
但回到过去是不可能的
but impossible to go back into the past.

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,450
我们现在每分钟都能穿越到下一分钟
Hey, we're time traveling now at one minute per minute.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,410
所以他算是在暗示一个事实
So he kind of was eluding to the fact

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,850
那就是《回到未来》里的一切都不可能发生
that everything in "Back To The Future" could never happen.

50
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,220
都是不可能的
Couldn't really happen.

51

当这个宝贝达到时速141公里时
When this baby hits 88 miles per hour,

142
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,650
你就能看到厉害的了
you're going to see some serious shit.

143
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,470
他达到目标时的那种兴奋感非同寻常
His excitement about achieving that is incredible.

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,620

时间线偏斜了一定的角度

产生了另一个1985年
creating an alternate 1985.

158
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,500
博士必须这么说
It's necessary for Doc to say it,

159
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,630
不是为了让故事吸引观众
not just for the audience to be caught up with the story,

160
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,020
而是因为他要说
but because he's gotta say --

161
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,350
"我必须这么做因为这件事如果发生了
"I've got to do this because of this because if that happens,

162
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,110
就会发生像这样的事情"

马蒂  无论发生什么
Marty, whatever happens,

164
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,080
你不能让其他的自己看到你
you must not let your other self see you.

165
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,430
那样结果会很糟糕
The consequences could be disastrous.

166
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,670
不好意思  先生
Excuse me, sir?

167
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,570
他非常恐惧  只要有一个判断失误
He's in total terror that one mistake of judgment

168
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,650
整个宇宙就瓦解了

这是每一个作家在时间旅行的故事里
This is the thing that every writer always struggles with

173
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,280
总是在纠结的事
in time travel stories.

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,310
如果你回到过去  在那里
If you go back in time and something that you do

175
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,770
做了某些事
when you're back there,

176
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,580
造成了你祖父的死亡
causes the death of your grandfather

177
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,830
当时他还没有让你祖母怀孕
before he has impregnated your grandmother,

178
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,920
你因此不再存在
and you therefore cease to exist.

179
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,070
但是如果你不存在
But if you cease to exist,

180
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,760
那你一开始
then you weren't around

181
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,630
就不会进入时间机器
to get in the time machine in the first place

182
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,090
然后回到过去做那样的事
and to go back in time and do that.

183
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,860
所以发生了什么
So what happens?

184
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,330
他们管它叫祖父悖论
They call it the grandfather paradox.

185
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,800
记住了  按照我的理论
Now remember, according to my theory

186
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,730
你干涉了你父母的第一次见面
you interfered with your parents first meeting.

187
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,970
如果他们不见面  他们就不会相爱
If they don't meet they won't fall in love,

188
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,780
他们不会结婚  也就不会有孩子
they won't get married, and they won't have kids.

189
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,230
《回到未来》很明确地摆出了它的规则
"Back To The Future" Laid out its rules so clearly,

190
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,400
它实际上教给了电影观众
it effectively taught the movie audience

191
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,700
你改变了过去的时候就会发生这种事
this is what happens when you change the past,

192
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,940
这就是另一条时间线可能的样子
this is what an alternate timeline might look like.

193
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,940
还有一些可怕的问题比如
There are also kind of creepy questions like

194
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,060
你妈妈在青少年的时候爱上了你怎么办
what happens when your mom falls in love with you as a teenager...

马蒂将自己八十年代的照片
is Marty's photograph of himself from the '80s,

199
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,220
带到五十年代
which he carries around with him back into the '50s

200
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,220
并时常看看确信自己还在照片中
and keeps looking at it to make sure he's still in the picture.

201
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,440
被抹去存在
Erased from existence.

202
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,550
那张照片本身显然就十分矛盾
So the photograph itself is obviously incredibly paradoxical.

203
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,760
因为如果他的父母从未见面的话
Because why would his brother and sister be there

204
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,060
照片上怎么会有弟弟妹妹
if his parents had never met?

205
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,000
当初又为什么会有这样一张照片
And like, why would there even have been a photograph

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,290
诸如此类
in the first place?

207
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,330
但没有人会停下来想这些
But nobody ever stops to think about that,

208
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,930
因为我们已经制定好了这条规则
because we've set up this rule that says that

209
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,240
当马蒂从照片中消失时
when Marty disappears from this photo,

210
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,470
他也会慢慢消失
he's going to fade out of existence.

211
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,720
用完美的戏剧手法表现了
It's a perfect dramatization of the idea

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,380
从时间线上消除自己的概念
of erasing yourself from the timeline.

《回到未来》设了个陷阱
"Back To The Future" really set up a mousetrap

218
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,320
来建立起完美的悬念

222

时间旅行打开了各种各样的可能性
Time travel opens up a lot of possibilities.

223
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,840
你可以有另一种过去
So you can have an alternate history,

224
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,280
可以有另一种现实
you can have an alternate present.

而且这种可能是无限的

231
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,210
为什么我们许许多多的幻想

233
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,870
都是关于时间旅行的呢

234
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,100

240
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,960
想象我回到过去并且说

241
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,990
"我不会拍《大力神在纽约》"

不会吧
I mean, it's like, unbelievable.

248
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,260
这就是你想回到过去做的事吗
That's the thing you want to go back and do?

249
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,480
不见见耶稣  不把希特勒干掉
Not meet Jesus, not kill Hitler.

250
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,510
你回去只想搞定一部电影
You want to go back and fix that one movie.

251
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,520
它困扰着你
This haunts you.

252
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,750
回去干掉希特勒或者回到古罗马时代
To go to kill Hitler or to go and be back in the Roman days,

253
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,870
要是能穿梭时间就棒极了
it would be really interesting to be able to time travel.

254
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,070
但问题是
But the question is,

255
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,100
如果在时间上来回穿梭是可行的
if you can move back and forth in time,

256
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,470
我们还能有自由意愿吗
do we have free will?

257
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,990
因为《终结者》系列电影的核心就在于此
Because "The Terminator" movies are kind of about that.

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
就是自由意愿
They're about free will.

259
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,300
如果某人从未来回来
If somebody comes back from the future

260
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
来改变当时的情况
to change what happens down there,

261
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,660
那我们岂不都是时间线上的傀儡
then are we just all puppets of a time line?

262
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,430
我完全相信你会弄明白的

That character was sent by John Connor in the future

283
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,810
派回过去
to go back in time

284
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,380
保护这个女孩不被终结者伤害的
to protect this girl from the Terminator.

285
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,110
他们抵达过去后展开了追逐
Once they're there, then you have this chase,

286
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,490
谁能营救莎拉·康纳  还是她会被杀
who's gonna rescue Sarah Connor or is she gonna get killed?

287
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,450
科幻作品提出了疑问  我们命运是已有定数
Science fiction is a great place to ask is our destiny fixed?

288
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,270
还是能够改变
Or can we change it?

289
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,690
我什么都没做啊
I didn't do anything.

290
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,060
你以后会做的
No, but you will.

291
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,960
问题在于  我们是否被困在了一系列事件中
The question is are we locked into one series of events?

292
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,590
乔纳森▪诺兰
编剧
《星际穿越》
问题在于  我们是否被困在了一系列事件中
The question is are we locked into one series of events?

293
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,140
问题在于  我们是否被困在了一系列事件中
The question is are we locked into one series of events?

294
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,060
比如  第一部电影结束的时候
Like, by the end of the first film,

295
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,880
你看到了他们一开始穿越到过去
you realize you're seeing the creation myth

296
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,200
想要阻止的创世神话
of the thing they've gone back to prevent in the first place.

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,220
《终结者2  审判日》
想要阻止的创世神话
of the thing they've gone back to prevent in the first place.

298
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,790
《终结者2  审判日》

299
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,520
第二部电影揭开了这个可能性
The 2nd film opens up the possibility
《终结者2  审判日》

300
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,530
第二部电影揭开了这个可能性
The 2nd film opens up the possibility

301
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,430
并且莎拉·康纳直接与之对话
and Sarah Connor speaks to it directly.

302
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,140
也许那不是困住我们的世界
Maybe that's not the universe we're stuck in.

303
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,160
没有命运
也许那不是困住我们的世界
Maybe that's not the universe we're stuck in.

304
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,210
也许那不是困住我们的世界
Maybe that's not the universe we're stuck in.

305
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,990
也许未来尚未写就
Maybe the future isn't written.

306
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,000
莎拉把刀插在桌子上  说道
Sarah sticks a knife in the table and says,

307
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,140
"世上没有命运  只有我们创造命运"
"There's no fate but what we make for ourselves."

308
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,840
她被告知她可以改变未来
She's been told that she can change the future.

309
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,240
但那是否只是个幻想
But is that just an illusion?

310
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,250
我们是不是在一部已经拍好的电影里
Are we basically in a movie that's already been shot?

311
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,360
胶片早就在某个地方卷好了
It's already rolled up in the can someplace?

312
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,350
有可能
That could be!

313
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,750
你可以随意快进或倒退
You can play it forward and backward as much as you want,

314
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,180
但结局永不改变
but the ending never changes?

315
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,120
我认为我们可以控制自己的未来
I think that we have control over ourselves

316
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,050
有能力去改变它
and I think that we have the power to create changes.

317
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,160
你儿子托我给你带个信
Your son gave me a message to give to you.

318
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,060
"未来犹未可知
"The future is not set.

319
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,360
你必须活着  否则我不会存在"
You must survive or I will never exist."

320
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,130
未来犹未可知
The future is not set.

321
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,390
是这样的台词
You know, I mean that's -- that's kind of the line --

322
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,680
未来犹未可知
the future's not set.

323
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,690
可以被改变
And it can be altered.

324
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,050
要我跟你说说你父亲吗
Should I tell you about your father?

325
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,860
如果你不让凯尔来找我的话  就没有你了
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

326
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,020
电影想要传达的是  你可以改变过去
The point that the film makes is that you can change history.

327
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,030
你可以逃离终结者
You can escape the Terminator.

328
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,970
但是时间旅行的重点不是过去
But time travel is not about history

329
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,620
也不是时间旅行本身
and it's not about time travel,

330
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,460
而是为生命中的
it's about accepting responsibility

331
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,290
各种可能性承担责任
for all the possibilities in your own life.

会出现在你面前
is going to show up in front of you...

而你不得不杀死他

你不得不去做

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,610
而年轻的自己才刚开始意识到
But the younger one is learning for the first time what's --

371
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,670
发生了什么
what's going on.

372
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,020
他自然有很多问题

373
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,810
你知道会发生什么
So do you know what's gonna happen?

374
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,150
我不想谈时间旅行
I don't wanna talk about time travel

375
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,750
因为一旦我们开始谈论它
because if we start talking about it

376
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,960
那我们一整天
then we're gonna be here all day

377
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,830
都得耗在这里画图表
talking about it, making diagrams with straws.

378

布鲁斯·威利斯
演员
《环形使者》

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
谈及时间旅行
Talking about time travel.
布鲁斯·威利斯
演员
《环形使者》

380
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,250
会让你疯狂
It makes you go crazy.

381
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,460
和年轻的自己
And the option of going through a conversation like that

382
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,440
进行那样一段对话更让人发疯
with you at a younger age would make you even crazier.

383
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,820
让开
Move, damnit.

384
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,790
故事利用时空旅行来
Time travel is a device that

385
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,710
探索人性  探索人类对待彼此的方式
story is using to tell a story about human nature

386
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,960
以及在此之下的原因
and how humans treat each other and why.

387
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,310
让开
Move.

388
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,660
接着我看见了
Then I saw it.

389
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,530
假如说《环形使者》讲述的是
If "Looper" Is a story about how violence

390
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,620
暴力滋生更多暴力  对我而言
perpetuates more violence, to me, the lesson is

391
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,790
它告诉我暴力只能制造更多更糟的问题
that you just create more problems and worse problems.

392
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,470
我看见了  而这条路是一个循环
I saw it... and the path was a circle.

393
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,750
这是改变自身命运的故事
It's kind of about changing your own destiny.

394
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,880
也是讲述自身的命运是如何
And it's kind of about how your destiny

395
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,980
由其它更强势的人所决定的故事
is always being shaped by people more powerful than yourself.

396
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,070
你怎么才能真正挣脱一个黑暗的循环呢
And how do you really get out of a dark cycle?

397
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,020
影片指出了另一条终止循环的方式
The movie is pointing out another way to end that cycle.

398
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,650
所以我改变了它
So I changed it.

399
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,690
这是个实存困境
It is an existential dilemma.
源于萨特的哲学概念
指人对自身的人生与选择的一种困境

400
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,650
很多时空穿越都在探讨这个哲学问题
A lot of time travel is very philosophical in that way.

401
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,630
乔最终通过自杀掌控了自己的人生
Joe finally takes control of his life by ending it.

402
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,430
我们为什么迷恋时空旅行
Why are we fascinated by time travel?

403
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:15,630
人们总是问我

408
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,820
我这样  我们都这样
It's -- I'm -- we are.

409
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,230
我们仿佛被困在时间中
We feel very trapped in it.

410
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,110
我们似乎是想要抓住每分每秒
It's like, we try to hang on to the moment.

411
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,540
我们什么玩意都拍下来  对不对
We take photographs of everything, right?

412
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,840
我们绝望地想要抓住当下的现实
We desperately want to hang on to

413
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,440
但它总会流逝
this reality and it recedes.

414
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,740
时空旅行让我们有机会设问
What time travel allows us to do is to say,

415
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,490
"要是我们能抓住呢
"Okay, but what if we could?

416
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,590
要是我们能扭转那一刻呢
What if we could preserve that moment.

417
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,290
要是我们可以回到那一刻呢"
What if we could revisit that moment, genuinely?"

418
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,230
这就是所有科幻作品的核心  设问
Well, that's all science fiction is about -- What if?

419
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,310
要是我们可以进行太空航行呢
What if we could travel through space,

420
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,550
要是我们可以进行时空旅行呢
what if we could travel through time?

《星际穿越》是一部不同寻常的时空旅行电影

我拍摄《星际穿越》时
and when I came to do "Interstellar,"

469
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,980
那并不是一部时间旅行电影
which is not a time travel movie

470
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,220
但它具备这个要素...
but has that element in it...

471
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,380
-在影片末尾时间被折叠了  -确实如此
- It does fold time at the end. - ‭It does.

472
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,140
但你的设定依然十分严谨
You still approached it very rigorously

473
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,110
你拜访了许多业界顶尖专家
by going to some of the top experts.

474
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,360
这是全过程中最让我着迷的部分
It was a really fascinating part of the process

475
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,960

一种是不可能实现的
There's the time travel that is probably impossible

488
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,150
也就是回到过去
and that's going backwards.

489
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,340
而另一种时间旅行  不仅有可能实现

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,650
科学上有个被称为"双生子悖论"的理论

495
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,930
主要是说如果我的双胞胎兄弟登上一艘飞船
which basically says that if my twin gets in a spaceship

496
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,600
并且以接近光速的速度航行
and goes traveling at, near to the speed of light,

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,710
沙恩·卡鲁斯
Shane Carruth.

563
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,230
他自导自演  特别帅气
He's in it, he's lovely in it.

564
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,650
它在干什么
What's it doing?

565
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,190
我不确定是不是我的错觉
I don't know if I'm making it up...

566
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,560
这两个人  亚伯和亚伦
These two guys, Abe and Aaron,

567
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,720
一直在研究这个现象
keep investigating this phenomenon.

568
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,240
他们的实验中出现了一个奇怪的情况
There's this weird anomaly that shows up.

569
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,300
最终他们发现他们创造出
What they finally realize is that they have created a space

570
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,520
一个可以实现时间旅行的空间
that you can travel through time in.

他们用这个原理造了一个更大的盒子
So they take this, and create a bigger box,

574
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,540
大到可以容纳人
big enough for a human to be in.

575
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,180
一开始他们使用时间旅行的目的非常世俗
When they do this, they use it for really mundane

576
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,700
非常符合一般人的想法
and very human purposes.

577
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,200
其中一人以此来炒股
One uses it to play the stock market.

578
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,990
时间旅行最终让朋友离间
And time travel ends up pulling the friends apart.

579
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,360
我只想知道你用了哪个盒子
I just want to know what box you used.

580
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,100
你只给自己造了一个盒子  对吧  只有一个
You built the one for you, right? Just the one?

581
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,440
对啊  不然你觉得我造了多少个
Yeah. ‭How many do you think I made?

582
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,480
他们互相怀疑对方
They are suspicious of each other

and they're also deceiving each other

586
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,050
因为穿越回过去影响了
because something about going back in time

587
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,350
他们的大脑
affects their brain,

588
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,320
他们真的日渐癫狂
and they do start losing their minds.

589
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,540
如同其他电影  《命运之门》明确暗示
Like many other movies, "Primer" does indeed suggest

590
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,460
时间旅行要付出代价
that there is a cost to time travel,

591
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,600
在这部电影里  代价体现在心理以及身体上
and in this case the cost is both emotional and physical.

592
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,230
你手怎么了  在流血吗
What's on your hand? Are you bleeding?

593
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,020
我们看到电影里的角色
So when we start seeing our characters show up,

594
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,560
他们耳朵流血
and they've got, you know, bloody ears,

595
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,620
不知道怎么写字
and they lose the ability to write,

596
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,440
右手写的字像左手写的
their right-handed writing looks like their left-handed writing,

597
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,420
他们大脑出现的问题
there's something going on mentally

598
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,550
正是他们付出的代价
that they are paying the price with.

599
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,650
时间旅行的故事就像浮士德
The time-travel story, it's a kind of Faustian tale.

600
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,440
和恶魔讨价还价
The bargain with the devil.

601
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,370
任何事都是一种交换
Everything is a barter.

602
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,620
如果你把灵魂出卖给恶魔
If you sell your soul to the devil,

603
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,080
你便可以得到想要的一切
you can have everything you ever dreamed of.

604
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,730
但最终你会付出代价
But eventually you pay the piper.

605
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,750
谁不想知道过去
Who doesn't wonder about the past?

606
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,590
谁又不想知道未来
Who doesn't wonder about the future?

607
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,370
这个游戏到底玩了多少遍了

611
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,220
你还记得第一次听说时间旅行是什么情形吗
Can you remember the first time you ever heard of time travel?

612
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,740
"古希腊人一定提到过时间旅行
"I think ancient Greeks must have had time travel.

613
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,210
莎士比亚的作品也一定提到了时间旅行"
Isn't there some time travel thing in Shakespeare?"

614
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,810
对吧  但并不是这样的

632
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,240
从未被放在一起使用  直到H.G.威尔斯

达尔文是在用几十亿万年的尺度

656
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,760
来讨论人类生命的历史

各种各样由因果关系导致的问题

这要从雷·布莱伯利的《雷霆万钧》说起

但你要留在这个悬浮的平台上
but you're going to be on this suspended platform.

680
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,240
你还可以射杀恐龙
And you can shoot a dinosaur,

681
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,460
但得保证它是即将死掉的
but it has to be one that was going to die anyway,

682
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,140
这样你就不会改变未来的任何事情
so that you don't change anything in the future.

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,990
可是有一位傲慢的猎人

原来世界的反乌托邦的样子
this kind of dystopian version of his own world

687
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,830
他几乎认不出来了
that he barely recognizes.

688
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,890
布莱伯利创造了这些具有深意的暗喻

时间旅行故事的作家们在考虑
When writers of time travel stories

698
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,200
一切所发生事情的逻辑后果时
consider the logical implications of everything that happens,

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,620
罗伯特·海因莱因是第一位从时间旅行悖论中
Robert Heinlein is the first writer to get the pleasure

701
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,060
获得愉悦感和兴趣的作家
and peculiarity of time travel paradoxes

702
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,890
也发现了它们可以被反复不断地利用
and how they can be exploited again and again and again.

703
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,600
他认为时间旅行故事所面临的问题
He sees that the problem with time travel stories

704
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,700
并不成为问题  而是一个机会
isn't a problem, it's an opportunity.

705
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,420
他写了一些故事  包括《你们这些僵尸》
He wrote stories like "All You Zombies,"

706
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,700
但是它和僵尸没有任何关系
which has nothing to do with zombies, by the way,

707
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,980
它讲述了可能是有史以来最令人困惑
but it has to do with probably the most completely confusing

708
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,400
也最令人愉悦的时间悖论科幻故事
and delightful science fiction time paradox story there is,

709
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,210
这个故事被改编成了电影《前目的地》
which was made into the film "Predestination."

710
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:07,870
我能做到这个  我能改变我的过去
I can do this, I can change my past.

711
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,130
《前目的地》
我能做到这个  我能改变我的过去
I can do this, I can change my past.

712
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,140
《前目的地》

713
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,300
是的  你能
Yes, you can.
《前目的地》

714
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,330
《前目的地》

715
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,430
你有没有想过改变你的过去呢
Have you ever thought about changing yours?
《前目的地》

716
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,370
你有没有想过改变你的过去呢
Have you ever thought about changing yours?

717
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,280
我从未偏离过自己的使命
I never deviate from the mission.

718
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,660
《前目的地》讲述的是
Predestination

719
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,010
一位雌雄间性的时间旅行者
is about an intersex time traveler

《前目的地》
一位雌雄间性的时间旅行者

722
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,440
她在生命的一开始是一位女性
who starts life as a woman --

723
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,580
后来被强迫转变性别  成了一位男性
is forced into gender reassignment, becomes a man.

724
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,060
然后这个男人穿越到过去
That man then travels back in time,

725
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,760
爱上了女性身份的自己
falls in love with his female self,

726
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,990
然后这位女性生了一个孩子
That female self then has a child

727
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,940
这个孩子成为了他们自己的造物
which ends up being the creation of themselves.

728
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,170
因此这是一个关于雌雄间性的
So it's an intersex time-traveling

729
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,110
时间旅行禁忌爱情故事
incest love story.

730
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,170
事实上《花花公子》杂志拒绝了这个故事
And in fact "Playboy" Magazine rejected the story

731
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,100
因为里面的性故事让《花花公子》的编辑
because all the sex made the editor queasy,

732
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
感到有些恶心
the editor of "Playboy."

733
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,850
我觉得这是因为跟自己发生性行为
Well, I think it had to do with the idea of having sex

734
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,990
而生出你自己的这个想法
with yourself to create yourself,

735
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,460
有一点疯狂
which is kind of crazy,

736
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,280
《花花公子》会对这样的情节有看法的
that "Playboy" would have an issue with something like that.

737
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,360
但那是1959年
But it was 1959.

738
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,560
这是一个古老的问题
Well, it's the age-old question --

739
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,770
是先有小鸡  还是先有蛋
which came first: the chicken or the egg?

740
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,760
而我们认为是先有"公鸡"
Yeah. We say the rooster.

741
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,810
有些事情是命中注定的  是吧
Some things are predestined, right?

742
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,020
我决定了你现在的样子
I made you who you are,

743
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,470
你决定了我现在的样子
you made me who I am,

744
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,810
这是个悖论  对吧
it's a paradox, right?

745
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,000
但它可以被修正
But it can be para-doctored!

未来就是现在
The future is now.

759
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,600
如此多的科幻电影都是关于这些聪慧的

科学家  天体物理学家  生物学家

到底是怎么了

800

我们来帮你们
"We're going to help you."

801
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,570
你知道蒙古人何时统治中国吗

802
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,350
或许我们可以问问他们

803
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,670
比尔和泰德当然可以接受这一切

他们有点像活在现代的傻瓜

806
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,370
有种永恒的乐观主义

807
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,530
克里斯·马特森和我有一段非常有趣的经历
We had a funny moment, Chris Matheson and I,

808
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,990
写剧本时
when we wrote it we were not involved

809
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,240
我们没有参与电影的选角
in the casting of the film,

810
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,950
所以不知道谁来演比尔和泰德
and didn't know who would play Bill and Ted.

811
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,350
我们飞到电影取景地  亚利桑那州
We had flown to Arizona where we were shooting the movie

812
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,440
我们在麦当劳排队
and we were at a McDonald's in line,

813
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,090
站在前面的几个孩子
and we saw a couple of kids in front of us

814
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,850
看起来吊儿郎当的  我们就想
and goofing off and we were like,

815
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,060
"就是那些小伙子
"Those are the guys,

816
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,130
该来演比尔和泰德"
that's who should be playing Bill and Ted!"

817
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,500
那天晚些时候  我们见到了基努和亚历克斯
And later on that day we met Keanu and Alex

818
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,620
正是麦当劳排在我们前面的小伙子们
and those were the guys that were in front of us

819
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,800
我们就想  "这很完美"
at McDonald's and we were like, "That's perfect."

820
00:30:59,800 --> 00:30:59,990
电话亭

at McDonald's and we were like, "That's perfect."

824

一个时空穿越电话亭
a time traveling phone booth by George Carlin

825
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,000
并通过时空设置了一个任务
and set upon a mission through spacetime.

826
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,160
我们从历史中收集各种各样的角色
We collect all the various characters from history

827
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,790
这将是你能拥有的最棒的报告
because that would be the most awesome report

828
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,540
因为能在其中看到历史人物本尊
you could have would be to actually have the real people there.

829
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,730
我们喜欢摆弄这些悖论
We love toying with all these paradoxes.

830
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,310
《比尔和泰德》这部电影我最喜欢的地方之一
And one of my favorite parts of the "Bill & Ted" movie

831
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,100
就是所有历史人物
is when all the historical figures are in jail

832
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,560
被关进监狱出不来
and they can't get out.

833
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,170
我们能用你爸的钥匙吗
Can we get your dad's keys?

834
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,500
-可以偷  -好想法  伙计
- Could steal 'em! - Good thinking dude!

835
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,460
报告完成后我们将穿越回两天前
After the report we'll time travel back to two days ago,

836
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,550
偷走你爸的钥匙  把他们留在这里
steal your dad's keys and leave them here.

837
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,880
看到了吧
See?!

838
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,460
所以报告完成后我们千万不能忘了
So after the report we can't forget to do this

839
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,960
否则这就不会发生
otherwise it won't happen.

840
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,060
泰德就像是在通过现在的自己
Ted is like connecting to his future self

841
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,500
与未来的自己联系
through his present self to know

842
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,590
来知道未来他会把钥匙藏在哪里
where his future self will want to hide the keys

843
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,480
因为未来的他已经知道过去的他做了什么
because the future self already knows what the past self did,

844
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,430
但是过去的他不知道未来的他会做什么
but the past self doesn't know what the future self did,

845
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,230
但是他知道自己的性格
but he knows the character.

846
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,680
来吧  泰德
Come on, Ted.

847
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,410
我们该去救几个历史人物了
We've got some historical figures to rescue.

848
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,880
而这完美地概括了
And it perfectly encapsulates the absurdity

849
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
时间旅行悖论的荒谬性
of the time travel paradox.

850
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,430
你只要记得过去已经做过一件事
You just have to remind yourself to have done them in the past

851
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,110
你就会在未来做这件事
and they will be done in the future.

852
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,190
我就想这真是太厉害了
And I just thought that was terrific.

853
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,210
就像是在说  好吧  别担心
It just says, yeah, don't worry about it.

854
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,330
很有意思的是  在科幻电影的历史长河中

859
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,430
能有这种"哦  太有趣了"的科幻电影
To have a sci-fi film that says, "Eh! This is just fun!"

860
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,170
带给人一种奇妙的解脱感
is an incredible strange relief.

861
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,890
不可能
No way!

862
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,450
它不是唯一一部
It's not the only science fiction film

863
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,110
拿时间旅行玩得很开心的电影
to have fun with time travel.

864
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,110
事实上  这部喜剧片第一次普及了

北美地区的一个传统节日  每年2月2日
与预报时令有关

871
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,200
《土拨鼠之日》把时间循环作为手段
"Groundhog Day" uses the device of a time loop

872
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,890
来探索你要如何才能改善自己

时间机器
"Time machine."

884
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,800
但是我不知道应该涉及什么
But I didn't really know what was going to be involved

885
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,970
或它是怎么运作的
or how it was going to work.

886

菲尔  菲尔  菲尔·康纳斯
Phil? Phil?! Phil Connors?

887
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,100
菲尔·康纳斯  我就知道是你
Phil Connors, I thought that was you.

888
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:21,220
我就想  好吧  不管怎么样  规则就是
I just thought, "Okay, whatever it is the rule is,

889
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,110
他可以记得  但是其他人不能记得
he can remember, but nobody else can remember.

890
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,300
所以对他们来说就是同一天
So for them it's just the same day.

891
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,150
而对他来说则是许多漫长的  重复的日子
And for him it's part of a long, long, long repetition of days."

892
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,740
而观众会学会期待这一点
And the audience learns to expect that,

893
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,110
他们可以和主角一起整理这一天的情况
and can begin to sort of map the day along with the character

894
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,810
并且尝试在主角之前找出
and see if they can figure out

895
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,540
脱离时间循环的方法
how to get out of this time loop before he does.

896
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,910
真正的时间机器  是你的大脑
The real time travel machine, is your brain.

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,740
不同时期的自己  回忆
through different versions of ourselves, memories,

902
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,280
白日梦  还有不同的可能性
and daydreams, alternate paths,

903
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,240
在其中  我们可能到达别的现实
where we might end up somewhere different.

904
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,260
你有记忆幻觉吗   兰卡斯特夫人
Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster?

905
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,910
应该没有  但是我可以去问一问厨房
I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen?

906
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,970
而这就是时间旅行帮我们提纯出来的
And this is what the time travel story crystallizes for us.

907
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,470
这是一种意识的模型
It's a model of consciousness,

908
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,120
在时间中时刻充满着究极的自由
which is constantly reeling with ultimate freedom through time,

909
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,050
但是最后不得不发现自己还是被困在现实世界
and then finding itself stuck, once again, in the real world.

910
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,290
在 《土拨鼠之日》的第一部分
In the first stretch of "Groundhog Day,"

911
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,720
比尔·莫瑞知道自己身上将要发生的所有事
Bill Murray knows everything that's gonna happen to him,

912
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,010
他可以利用这些  为自己谋利
he can make that work to his advantage.

913
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,560
他采取的手段就像是青少年会做的
And he does it in the way an adolescent would,

914
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,870
纯粹为了取乐  或者说像是一个反社会人格
just having fun and also becoming kind of sociopathic.

915
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,410
他不在乎其他人
You don't really care about the other people.

916
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,290
他们就是他生活中的道具
They are objects in your life.

917
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,120
然后下一个阶段是抑郁
And then it moves on to a depression

918
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,880
他最终决定自杀
where he finally decides to kill himself.

919
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,210
然而他发现他无法做到
And he finds that he cannot even do that.

920
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,700
这是汤姆  他以前在煤矿工作
This is Tom, he worked in the coal mine

921
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,800
后来矿倒闭了
until they closed it down.

922
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,880
这里是他第一次
This is where he, for the first time

923
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,810
开始意识到其他人
starts to notice other people,

924
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,360
意识到他们也有自己的生活
and realizes that they have lives, too,

925
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,740
他是社区的一员
and that he's part of a community

926
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,020
通过重新认识自己
and by seeing himself differently,

927
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,310
他也开始重新认识世界
he actually opens up a whole new world to himself.

928
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,850
老人家  我们去个暖和点的地方吧
Hello, father, let's get yourself someplace warm.

929
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,800
困在时间循环里的好处在于
The wonderful thing about being stuck in a time loop,

930
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,020
我们能从不同的角度审视自己的生活
it makes us look at our lives in a fresh way

931
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,980
这也是电影其中一个好处
which is one of the great things that movies can do,

932
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,460
特别是科幻作品
and especially science fiction,

933
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,450
因为它即刻就能让你
because it can so immediately place you

934
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,180
置身于不同的时空
in a different time and place.

935
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,200
也许我们都需要一部时间旅行电影
Maybe we all do need a time travel movie

936
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,740
让我们能成为更好的自己
to make us a better version of ourselves,

937
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,610
希望我们不要像他被困这么长时间就好
but I hope that we're not stuck as long as he is.

938
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,170
只要有一点不同就很棒
Anything different is good.

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,910
你是黑暗的一方  你是戴立克的敌人
You are the dark side, you are an enemy of the Daleks.

978
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,130
是的没错
Oh, yes, I am.

979
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,090
消灭
Exterminate!

986
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,840
通过那些闪烁的蓝色画面
and through these flickering little blue images

987
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,280
我像是去到了不同的星球
I'd be taken to other planets with strange creatures

988
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,900
看到了充满想象力的新奇事物
with wonderful imaginative designs.

989
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,240
你觉得你是第一个想要杀死我的人吗
Do you think you're the first to try and kill me?

990
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,300
《神秘博士》总有点廉价电影的感觉
And also there has always been a kind of B-movie element to it,

991
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,030
我一直很喜欢
which I've always loved.

992
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,400
-这里有什么邪恶吗  -没什么东西邪恶
- Is everything out here evil? - Hardly anything is evil.

993
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,290
大多数只是饿了
But most things are hungry.

994
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,850
从食物链的另一端看  饥饿就是邪恶
Hunger looks very like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery

995
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,430
你认为你的培根三明治也爱你吗
or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?

996
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,610
我认为《神秘博士》很有魅力的一点
I think one of the things that's appealing about "Doctor Who,"

997
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,210
在于他的英式幽默
is there's a tradition of English humor

加里·K·沃尔夫

在于他的英式幽默
is there's a tradition of English humor

999
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:33,980
在于他的英式幽默
is there's a tradition of English humor

1000
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,240
好像未来就是一个笑话
which suggests that the future is all a joke.

1001
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,510
他是位时间领主
He's a Time Lord, yes.

1002
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,360
他能在时间线中自如穿梭
And he can travel back and forth in time,

1003
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
但他老做些荒唐可笑的事情
and he does it in absurd ways.

1004
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,720
时间和空间相对维度
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.

1005
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,410
简称"塔迪斯"
TARDIS for short.

1006
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,220
博士的时光机  塔迪斯
The Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS,

1007
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,550
是最棒的时间机器之一
is one of the best ever because it invokes

1008
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,340
因为它包含着物理学
the playing with physics

1009
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,560
是时空旅行中很必要的元素
that is going to be necessary to travel through time and space

1010
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,800
他的塔迪斯里面的空间
because his machine is bigger on the inside

1011
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,350
比外面看起来要大
than it is on the outside.

1012
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,320
你的盒子可以移动
So your box can move.

1013
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,140
我们能去我们想去的任何地方
We can go anywhere we like.

1014
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,530
博士总有一个人类同伴
He always has a human companion.

1015
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,220
他带着同伴
And he brings that companion

1016
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,920
去各处探险
along with him on his adventures.

1017
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,560
-我们在哪  -道路的尽头
- Where are we? - The end of the road.

1018
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,020
最后的星球
The last planet.

1019
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,560
他的心中仿佛人类总占据特别之地
He seems to have a special place in his heart for humans.

他的心中仿佛人类总占据特别之地
He seems to have a special place in his heart for humans.

1021
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,360
他的心中仿佛人类总占据特别之地
He seems to have a special place in his heart for humans.

1022
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,380
选择普通人
Picking individual ordinary people

1023
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,640
带他们见识所有的时间和空间
and showing them all of time and space

1024
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,260
让他们更加全面地理解生命
and giving them a broader view on life.

1025
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,860
他也是医生  医生会做什么
He's the Doctor. What do doctors do?

1026
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,130
他们救死扶伤  拯救危难于水火
They heal sick situations, sick people.

1027
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,700
戴维·杰罗尔德
编剧
《星际旅行》《巴比伦五号》
他们救死扶伤  拯救危难于水火
They heal sick situations, sick people.

1028
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:39,760
他们救死扶伤  拯救危难于水火
They heal sick situations, sick people.

1029
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,730
可你为什么要毁掉这一切
But why do you have to destroy?

1030
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,940
就不能动动脑吗
Can't you use your brains?

1031
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,540
只有一个种族能活下来
Only one race can survive.

1032
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,720
这是场邪恶且毫无意义的杀戮
This senseless evil killing.

1033
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,730
博士的第一位扮演者  威廉·哈特内尔病了
The first actor, the wonderful William Hartnell, became ill

1034
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,840
不能继续拍摄
and couldn't carry on with the show.

1035
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,580
于是大家提出了一个非常棒的想法
So they came up with this rather brilliant idea,

1036
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,740
让博士有重生的能力
which is that the Doctor has the ability to reconstitute himself.

1037
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,120
这个设定让剧集得以延续
This has allowed this show to last

1038
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,440
因为我们每隔三四年就会更换主演
because we change the lead actor every three or four years,

1039
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,380
这是绝无仅有的
which no other show does.

1040
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,380
它也有其他层面的哲学性
It has all these other levels of philosophical

1041
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,220
引人思考
and reflective nature

1042
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,880
让这部剧有着非常  非常丰富的内涵
that make it very, very rich.

1043
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,370
人们总是问我  为什么这部剧
People always ask me what is it about the show

1044
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,910
能吸引这么多人
that appeals so broadly?

1045
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,010
我的答案呢
The answer I would like to give

1046
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,260
虽然不情愿这么说
and which I'm discouraged from giving,

1047
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,530
毕竟无助于剧集的推广
because it is not useful in the promotion of a brand,

1048
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,830
其实整部剧讲的是死亡
is that it's about death.

1049
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
《神秘博士》有非常强烈的主题  就是死亡
And it has a very, very powerful death motif in it,

1050
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,990
主角全部死了
which is that the central character dies.

1051
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,700
博士  放手吧
Doctor, let it go.

1052
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,850
一切都来得及
Time enough.

1053
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,210
我认为这是这部剧最为神秘的一点
And I think that is one of its most potent mysteries.

1054
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,770
因为在剧中某处
Because somewhere in that,

1055
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,760
人们能透过电视剧看到生活
people see that that's what happens in life.

1056
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:22,860
你所爱的人离你而去
You have loved ones, and then they go,

1057
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,460
但你的生活必须继续下去
but you must carry on.

1058
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,810
在时间旅行的故事中  人们想了很多办法
There are a lot of ways in which time travel stories

1059
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,850
偷偷地逃避死亡
sneakily are about eluding death.

时间这个混蛋
Time is a bastard.

1064
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,140
冥冥之中  我们的灵魂听到有关时间旅行的事
There's something that speaks to our souls about time travel

1065
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,280
这有些宿命论的意味
where there's a fatalism involved

1066
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,880
克里斯托弗·诺兰
导演/制片人
这有些宿命论的意味
where there's a fatalism involved

1067
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,370
这有些宿命论的意味
where there's a fatalism involved

1068
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,890
-但多少又让人觉得安心  -是这样
- that is reassuring somehow. - Right.

1069
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,750
因为时间旅行能告诉你
‭Because it tells you that the mistakes

1070
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,390
哪些错误会一直出现
were always gonna happen.

1071
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,120
非常有趣的一件事是
I mean, one of the fascinating things --

1072
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,880
有一天我向我的孩子解释说
I was explaining to my kids the other day --

1073
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,940
可以用望远镜实现时间旅行
that if you look at the idea of a telescope.

1074
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,550
望远镜能从时间上回顾过去
Telescope is a way of looking back in time,

1075
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:04,730
-它是时间机器  -是空间角度之外的
- It's a time machine. - ...and not just space.
望远镜能从时间上回顾过去
Telescope is a way of looking back in time,

1076
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,600
-它是时间机器  -是空间角度之外的
- It's a time machine. - ...and not just space.

1077
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,230
望远镜就是时间机器
It's a time machine.

1078
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,680
如果从更远处望向最小的那颗星
And you look at the smallest star, the further away,

1079
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,310
你看到的是更加遥远的过去
the further back in time you're looking.

1080
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,860
理论上讲  你可以造出
And theoretically you could make more

1081
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,840
性能更强的望远镜
and more powerful telescopes,

1082
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,830
这样就能看到更久远的过去
and you can look further and further back in time.

1083
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,080
是个有些烧脑的想法
It's just a mind-boggling concept.

1084
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,370
理论上讲  太阳很可能已经
Theoretically ‭the sun could have gone out

1085
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,830
在七分半前熄灭了  而我们还不知道
seven and a half minutes ago and we just don't know yet

1086
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,020
因为光传递到这儿  是需要时间的
'cause it takes light a while to get here.

1087
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
没错  希望这种事不要发生
Exactly. Let's hope not.

1088
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,290
就时间而言  你在回望过去的同时
But that idea of looking back in time

1089
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,470
也在看向现实世界
as you look out into the world,

1090
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,480
就在这间屋子里  你环顾四周
the fact that everything we see in this room

1091
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,230
就是在回顾时间
when you look around, you're looking back in time.

1092
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,730
我认为时间旅行故事
I think the potential is limitless

1093
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,060
潜力无限
for time travel stories...

1094
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,210
克里斯  谢谢你接受采访
Chris, thanks for doing this.

1095
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,650
不  要谢谢你邀请了我
No, thank you for having me.

1096
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,900
-光是谈论就让人觉得兴奋  -那很好
- It's exciting to talk about. - Okay. Good.

1097
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,190
好了  可以帮我们喊停了
All right, give us a cut then.

1098
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,030
我给你喊停吧  拍摄结束
I'll give you a cut. Done.

1099
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,180
-结束了  -回家了
- Done. - Going home.
