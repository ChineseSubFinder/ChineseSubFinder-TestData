1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,934  X1:081 X2:165 Y1:504 Y2:523
CREAK

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,009  X1:335 X2:384 Y1:504 Y2:523
Run.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,968  X1:098 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:527
- I'm The Doctor, by the way. What's your name?
- Rose.
- Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,288  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:504 Y2:527
Run for your life.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,368  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:527
It'll follow us!
The hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through
that door. Believe me, they tried.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,655  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:504 Y2:527
Are you alien? Yes.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,734  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:474 Y2:527
You could come with me.
Is it always this dangerous? Yeah.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,171  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:504 Y2:527
Right, Rose Tyler, you tell me -

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,048  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:474 Y2:523
where do you wanna go? Backwards
or forwards in time? Your choice.

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,335  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:504 Y2:527
What's it gonna be?

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,614  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:504 Y2:523
Forwards.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,975  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:504 Y2:527
How far? ...One hundred years.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,778  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:504 Y2:523
TARDIS REVS AND GROANS

14
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,932  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:527
Step outside those doors - it's
the 22nd century. You're kidding.

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,330  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:474 Y2:527
That's a bit boring, though.
D'you wanna go further? Fine by me.

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,288  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:504 Y2:527
Ten thousand years in the future.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,532  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:527
Step outside - it's the year 12005.
The new Roman Empire.

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,659  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:474 Y2:527
You think you're so impressive.
I am so impressive. You wish!

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,528  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:527
Right, then. You asked for it.
I know exactly where to go.

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,850  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:504 Y2:523
Hold on!

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,816  X1:080 X2:426 Y1:504 Y2:523
TARDIS GROANS AND ROARS

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,613  X1:082 X2:146 Y1:504 Y2:523
PING!

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,732  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:504 Y2:523
Where are we?

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,811  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:504 Y2:523
FAINT CREAKS

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,290  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:504 Y2:523
What's out there?

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,693  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:527
You lot... you spend all your time
thinking about dying.

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,571  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:527
Like you're gonna get killed
by eggs or beef
or global warming or asteroids.

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,529  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:527
But you never take time to imagine
the impossible,
that maybe you survive.

29
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,213  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:504 Y2:527
This is the year 5.5/Apple/26.

30
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,655  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:504 Y2:527
Five billion years in your future.

31
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,890  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:504 Y2:527
And this is the day...

32
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,857  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:504 Y2:523
Hold on...

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,568  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:504 Y2:527
This is the day the sun expands.

34
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,654  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:504 Y2:523
Welcome to the end of the world.

35
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,374  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:504 Y2:527
Shuttles five and six now docking.

36
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,371  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:504 Y2:523
Guests are reminded

37
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,897  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:527
that Platform One forbids the use of
weapons, teleportation and religion.

38
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,697  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:504 Y2:526
Earth-death is scheduled for 15:39,

39
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,295  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:384 Y2:407
followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.

40
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,888  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:354 Y2:407
So when it says "guests",
does that mean people?

41
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,131  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:354 Y2:407
Depends what you mean by people.
I mean people. What do you mean?

42
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,896  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:474 Y2:527
Aliens. What are they doing on board
this space-ship? What's it all for?

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,972  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:523
It's not really a spaceship,
more like an observation deck.

44
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,019  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:474 Y2:527
The great and the good are gathering
to watch the planet burn. What for?

45
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,419  X1:336 X2:382 Y1:504 Y2:523
Fun.

46
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,649  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:474 Y2:527
Mind you, when I say "the great and
the good" what I mean is the rich.

47
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,211  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:474 Y2:527
But, hold on, they did this once on
Newsround Extra, the sun expanding,

48
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,177  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:504 Y2:527
it takes hundreds of years. Millions.

49
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,412  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:527
But the planet's now the property
of the National Trust.
They've been keeping it preserved.

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,334  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:527
See down there? Gravity satellites
holding back the sun.

51
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,333  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:527
The planet looks
the same as ever. I thought
the continents shifted and things.

52
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,132  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:527
They did. The Trust moved 'em back.
That's a Classic Earth. Now the
money's run out, nature takes over.

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,733  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:504 Y2:527
How long's it got?

54
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,017  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:474 Y2:527
About half an hour.
Then the planet gets roasted.

55
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,170  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:504 Y2:527
Is that why we're here?

56
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,171  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:504 Y2:527
I mean, is that what you do?

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,376  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:474 Y2:523
Jump in at the last
minute and save the Earth?

58
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,974  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm not saving it. Time's up.

59
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,054  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:527
But what about the people? It's
empty. They've all gone. All left.

60
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,289  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:527
Just me, then.
Who the hell are you?

61
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,531  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oh, that's nice. Thanks(!)
But how did you get in?

62
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,648  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:527
This is a maximum hospitality zone,
the guests have disembarked. They're
on their way! Any second now...

63
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,736  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:527
No, that's me, I'm a guest. Look,
I've got an invitation. Look. Y'see?
It's fine. "The Doctor plus one".

64
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,611  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:527
I'm the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler,
she's my plus one. That all right?
Well, obviously.

65
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,736  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:504 Y2:527
Apologies, et cetera.

66
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,096  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:523
If you're on board,
we'd better start.

67
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,329  X1:327 X2:392 Y1:504 Y2:527
Enjoy.

68
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,896  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:474 Y2:523
The paper's slightly psychic. It
shows whatever I want them to see.

69
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,895  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:474 Y2:523
Saves a lot of time.
He's blue. Yeah... OK.

70
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,977  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:527
We have in attendance the Doctor
and Rose Tyler. Thank you.
All staff to their positions!

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,656  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:527
Hurry now! Thank you! Quick as
we can, come along, come along!

72
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,134  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:527
And now, might I introduce
the next honoured guest?
Representing the Forest of Cheam

73
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,938  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:504 Y2:526
we have trees,

74
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,693  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:504 Y2:527
namely Jabe, Lute and Coffa.

75
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,333  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:527
There will be an exchange of gifts
representing peace. If you could keep
the room circulating, thank you...

76
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,768  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:474 Y2:526
Next, from the solicitors Jolco &
Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.

77
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,772  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:527
And next,
from Financial Family Seven,

78
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,932  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:474 Y2:527
we have
the Adherents of the Repeated Meme.

79
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,572  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:474 Y2:527
The inventors of hyposlip travel
systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen!

80
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,895  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:527
..Cal "Spark" Plug... Mrs and Mrs
Pacoon... The ambassadors from
the City-State of Binding Light...

81
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,577  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:527
A gift of peace. I bring you
a cutting of my grandfather.

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,458  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:474 Y2:526
Thank you, yes...
Gifts, um...

83
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,134  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:504 Y2:527
Ahem! I give you in return...

84
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,892  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:504 Y2:527
air from my lungs.

85
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,572  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:504 Y2:523
How... intimate.

86
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,573  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:523
There's more where that came from.
I bet there is.

87
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,780  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:527
..Our friend from
the Silver Devastation, the sponsor
of the main event, please welcome...

88
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,738  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:504 Y2:523
..the Face of Boe.

89
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,209  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:504 Y2:523
The Moxx of Balhoon.

90
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,610  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:527
My felicitations
upon this historical happenstance.

91
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,611  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:504 Y2:527
I bring the gift of bodily salivas.

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,612  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:527
HAWKS AND SPITS
Thank you very much.

93
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,816  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:474 Y2:527
Ah, the Adherents of the Repeated
Meme! I bring you air from my lungs.

94
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,452  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:504 Y2:527
A gift of peace. In all good faith.

95
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,533  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:474 Y2:527
..And last but not least,
our very special guest.

96
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,455  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:526
Ladies and gentlemen
and trees and multiforms,

97
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,499  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:527
consider the Earth, below.
In memory of this dying world,

98
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,218  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:504 Y2:523
we call forth...

99
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,531  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:504 Y2:523
the Last Human.

100
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,057  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:474 Y2:523
The Lady Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta
Seventeen.

101
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,452  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oh, now don't stare! I know,
I know - it's shocking, isn't it?

102
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:34,730  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've had my chin completely taken
away, and look at the difference,
look how thin I am!

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,493  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:504 Y2:527
Thin and dainty!

104
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,730  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:504 Y2:527
I don't look a day over 2, 000.

105
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,618  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:504 Y2:527
(Moisturise me, moisturise me!)

106
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,978  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Truly, I am the Last Human.
My father was a Texan, my
mother was from the Arctic Desert.

107
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:59,057  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
They were born on the Earth,
and they were the last to be buried
in its soil.

108
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,610  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:504 Y2:523
I have come to honour them...

109
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,419  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:474 Y2:527
HER VOICE BREAKS

111
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,613  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,656  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:504 Y2:523
But behold!

113
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,571  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:504 Y2:527
I bring gifts!

115
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,134  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
Legend says
it had a wing-span of 50 feet
and blew fire from its nostrils.

116
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,290  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:504 Y2:527
Or was that my THIRD husband?

117
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,659  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oh, no, oh, don't laugh,
I'll get laughter-lines. No, stop!

118
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,699  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:474 Y2:527

120
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,812  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:526
According to the archives,
this was called an iPod,

121
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,813  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:527
it stores classical music from
humanity's greatest composers.

135
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,697  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:474 Y2:527
Er, no, you're very kind,
but I'm just the steward.

136
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,214  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:474 Y2:527
A gift of PEACE.

138
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,414  X1:304 X2:414 Y1:504 Y2:523
Of course.

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,172  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:504 Y2:527
Identify species.

140

Please identify species.

141
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,293  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:474 Y2:523
Now stop it! Identify his race.
Where's he from?

142
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,848  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:504 Y2:523

143
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,970  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:504 Y2:527
It's impossible.

144
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,854  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:504 Y2:527
Sorry, am I allowed to be in 'ere?

145
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,331  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:527
..You have to give us
permission to talk.

146

Thank you.

149
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,332  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:527

What's your name?

152
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,451  X1:319 X2:400 Y1:504 Y2:523
Raffalo.

153
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,053  X1:316 X2:404 Y1:504 Y2:523
Raffalo?

154
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,778  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:504 Y2:526
Yes, miss.

155
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,853  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:474 Y2:527
I... I won't be long I've just got
to carry out some maintenance.

156
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,728  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:474 Y2:523
There's a tiny little glitch
in the Face of Boe's suite.

157
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,658  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:527
There must be something blocking
the system. He's getting no hot
water. So... you're a plumber?

158
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,731  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:504 Y2:527
That's right miss.

159
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,050  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:504 Y2:527
They still have plumbers?

160
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,529  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:504 Y2:527
I hope so, else I'm out of a job!

161
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,453  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:504 Y2:527
Where are you from? Crespallion.

162
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,371  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:504 Y2:527
That's a planet, is it?

163
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,979  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, Crespallion's part
of the Jaggit Brocade affiliated
to the Scarlet Junction. Convex 56.

164
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,010  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:526
And where are you from, miss?
If you don't mind my asking?
No, not at all...

165
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,216  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:504 Y2:526
Um, I dunno

166
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,768  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:504 Y2:527
A long way away.

167
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,172  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:523
I just sort of hitched a lift
with this man...

168
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,811  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:523
I didn't even think about it.
Don't even know who he is.

169
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,495  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:504 Y2:527
He's a complete stranger.

170
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,695  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:474 Y2:523
Anyway, um, don't let me keep you.
Good luck with it!

171
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,169  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:504 Y2:527
Thank you, miss. And, er...

172
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,048  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:527
thank you for the permission. Not
many people are that considerate.

173
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,938  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:504 Y2:527
OK... See you later.

174
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,018  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:504 Y2:526
Now, then.

175
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,092  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:527
Control, I'm at junction 19. I think
the problem's coming from in here.

176
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,296  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'll go inside and have a look.

178
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,612  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:504 Y2:527

182
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,379  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:474 Y2:527

control. How many of you ARE there?

186

200
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,219  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:504 Y2:527
That's a... sort of plant.

201
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,972  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:504 Y2:527
We might be related.

202
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,778  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm talking to a twig.

203
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,808  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oi now, careful with that,
park it properly. No scratches.

206
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,578  X1:311 X2:406 Y1:504 Y2:527
Aye-aye!

207
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,895  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:504 Y2:527
What d'you think, then? Great, yeah.

208
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,293  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:527
Fine. Once you get past
the slightly psychic paper.

209
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,929  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:504 Y2:527
They're just so alien!

210
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,252  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:504 Y2:523
The aliens are so alien.

211
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,732  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:474 Y2:527
You look at 'em...
and they're alien.

212
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,380  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:527
Good thing I didn't take you
to the deep South(!)

213
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,171  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:504 Y2:527
Where are you from?

214
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,490  X1:263 X2:453 Y1:504 Y2:527
All over the place.

215
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,973  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:527
They all speak English. No,
you just hear English. It's a gift
of the Tardis. Telepathic field,

gets inside your brain, translates.
It's inside MY brain?

217
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,373  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:474 Y2:527
Well, in a good way.
Your machine gets inside my head?

218
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,580  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
It gets inside and it changes
my mind, and you didn't even ask?
I didn't think about it like that.

219
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,892  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:474 Y2:527
No, you were too busy thinking up
cheap shots about the deep South!

220
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,215  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:527
Who are YOU, then, Doctor? What're
you called? What sort of alien
are you? I'm just the Doctor.

>From what planet? It's not as if
you'd know it where it is(!) Where
are you from? What's it matter?

222
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,055  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:527
Tell me who you are! THIS is who
I am, right here, right now,
all right? All that counts

223
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,770  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:527
is here and now. And this is me.
Yes, and I'm here too, cos you
brought me here. So just tell me!

224
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,413  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:504 Y2:526
'Earth-death in 20 minutes,

225
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,257  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:504 Y2:523
'Earth-death in 20 minutes.'

226
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,332  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:504 Y2:527
All right.

227
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,778  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:474 Y2:527
As my mate Shireen says, don't argue
with the designated driver.

228
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,373  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:504 Y2:527
Can't exactly call for a taxi.

229
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,293  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:504 Y2:527
No signal.

230
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,053  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:504 Y2:527
We're out of range. Just a bit.

231
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,658  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:527
Tell you what. With a little bit
of jiggery-pokery... Is that a
technical term, jiggery-pokery(?)

232
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,459  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:474 Y2:527
Yes, I came first in jiggery-pokery.
What about you?

233
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,974  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:504 Y2:526
No, failed hullabaloo. Aw.

234
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,813  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:504 Y2:527
There you go.

235
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,851  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:504 Y2:523
PHONE RINGS AT OTHER END

236
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,454  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:474 Y2:527
Hello? Mum? Oh, what is it?
What's wrong, what have I done now?

237
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,579  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:527
Ooh, this red top's falling to bits!
You should get your money back.

238
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,734  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:527
Go on, there must be something.
You never phone in the middle
of the day... What's so funny?

239
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,654  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:474 Y2:527
Nothing. You all right, though?
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

240
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,972  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:474 Y2:527
What day is it? Wednesday all day.
You got a hangover?

241
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:56,374  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:527
Ooh, I tell you what, put a quid
in that lottery syndicate. I'll pay
you back later. Yeah, um, I...

242
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:03,377  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:527
I was just calling cos... I might
be late home. Is there something
wrong? No, I'm fine.

243
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,054  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:504 Y2:527
Top of the world!

244
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,374  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:527
Think THAT'S amazing,
you wanna see the bill.

245
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,052  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:504 Y2:527
That was five billion years ago.

246
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,732  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:504 Y2:523
So...

247
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,253  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:504 Y2:523
She's dead now.

248
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,450  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:527
Five billion years later,
my mum's dead.

249
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,417  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:504 Y2:527
Bundle of laughs, you are.

250
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,456  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:504 Y2:523
BIG RUMBLE

251
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,256  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:504 Y2:527
That's not supposed to happen.

252
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,776  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:527
Well, what was it? I'm just
getting green lights at this end.

253
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,493  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:527
Honoured guests may be reassured
that gravity pockets may cause
slight turbulence. Thanking you...

254
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,299  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:504 Y2:527
The whole place shook! I felt it!

255
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,012  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:527
I've hosted all sorts of events
on platforms 1, 3, 6 and 15 and
never felt the slightest tremor.

256
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,819  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:474 Y2:523
I warn you, if this lot decide
to sue...!

257
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,936  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm gonna scan the infrastructure.

258
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,772  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:474 Y2:523
CLICKS AND SQUEAKS
What's that?

259
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,650  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:527
Control, I don't want to worry you
but I'm picking up readings...

260
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,450  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:474 Y2:527
I have no idea! They're small.
The scan says they're metal...

261
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,770  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:504 Y2:527
I don't know what they look like!

262
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,452  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:474 Y2:523
Although I imagine they might look
rather like that.

263
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,214  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:504 Y2:527
You're not on the guest list.

264
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,098  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:504 Y2:527
How did you get on board?

265
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,250  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:504 Y2:523
No! 'Sunfilter deactivated.'

266
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,693  X1:341 X2:377 Y1:504 Y2:523
No!

267
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,816  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:504 Y2:527
'Sunfilter descending.' No!

268
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,049  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:504 Y2:527
Sunfilter up!

269
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,971  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:504 Y2:526
No, no, no!

270
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,813  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:474 Y2:527
Control! Respond!
'Sunfilter descending.'

271
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,413  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:504 Y2:523
SUNFILTER UP!

272
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,617  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:474 Y2:523
'Sunfilter descending... '
HE SCREAMS

273
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:13,055  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Indubitably, this is the Bad-Boo
scenario. I find the inherent laxity
of the unknown multiverse...

274
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,090  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:527
That wasn't a gravity pocket, I know
gravity pockets, and they don't feel
like that... What d'you think, Jabe?

275
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,934  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:527
Listen to the engines.
They've pitched up about 30 hertz.
Is that dodgy or what?!

276
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:29,289  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:527
It's the sound of metal - it doesn't
make any sense to me. Where's
the engine room? I don't know.

277
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:35,250  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:527
But the maintenance duct
is just behind our guest suite.
I could show you. And... your wife.

278
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,092  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:504 Y2:527
Oh, she's not my wife.

279
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,455  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:504 Y2:523
Partner? No. Concubine?

280
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,939  X1:328 X2:390 Y1:504 Y2:527
Nope.

281
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,048  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:474 Y2:527
Prostitute? Whatever I am,
it must be invisible(!) D'you mind?!

282
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,534  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:524
Tell you what, you two go...
pollinate. I'll catch up with family.
Quick word with Michael Jackson.

283
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,417  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:504 Y2:527
Don't start a fight.

284
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,968  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm all yours.

285
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,691  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:504 Y2:527
And I want you home by midnight.

286
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,456  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:523
'Earth-death in 15 minutes.
Earth-death in 15 minutes.'

287
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,093  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:474 Y2:527
Who's in charge of Platform One?
Has it got a captain or what?

288
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:26,130  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:527
There's just the steward and staff.
All the rest is controlled by the
metalmind. You mean the computer?

289
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,780  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:474 Y2:527
Well, who controls that?
The Corporation.

290
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,933  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:523
They move Platform One
from one artistic event to another.

291
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,970  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:527
There's no-one from the corporation
on board? They're not needed.
This facility is purely automatic.

292
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,812  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:504 Y2:527
It's the height of the Alpha Class.

293
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,130  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:504 Y2:527
Nothing can go wrong. Unsinkable(?)

294
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,769  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:474 Y2:527
If you like. The nautical metaphor
is appropriate.

295
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,216  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:474 Y2:527
You're telling me! I was on board
another ship they called unsinkable.

296
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,337  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:523
I ended up clinging to an iceberg.
Wasn't half cold.

297
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,448  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:527
So what you're saying is
if we get in trouble,
there's no-one to help us out.

298
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,213  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:504 Y2:523
I'm afraid not. Fantastic!

299
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,938  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:504 Y2:523
I don't understand.

300
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,818  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:504 Y2:527
In what way is that fantastic?

301
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,978  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:474 Y2:527
Soon the sun
will blossom into a red giant

302
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,573  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:504 Y2:527
And my home will die.

303
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,130  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:474 Y2:527
That's where I used to live,
when I was a little boy. Down there.

304
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,410  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:526
Mummy and Daddy had a house built
into the side of the Los Angeles
Crevasse. Ah, I'd have such fun.

305
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,254  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:474 Y2:527
What happened to everyone else?
The human race, where did it go?

306
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,458  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:474 Y2:527
They say mankind has touched
every star in the sky.

307
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,531  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:504 Y2:527
So you're not the last human.

308
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,135  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:504 Y2:523
I am the Last Pure Human.

309
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,178  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:504 Y2:527
The others... mingled.

310
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,209  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:527
Oh, they call themselves
New Humans and Protohumans and
Digihumans - even Human-ish -

311
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,860  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:504 Y2:527
but d'you know what I call them?

312
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,658  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:504 Y2:527
Mongrels.

313
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,413  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:504 Y2:527
Right(!) And you stayed behind.

314
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,378  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:504 Y2:527
I kept myself pure.

315
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,815  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:504 Y2:527
How many operations have you had?

316
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,050  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:504 Y2:526
708. Next week, it's 709.

317
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,098  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm having my blood bleached.

318
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,172  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:504 Y2:527
Is that why you wanted a word?

319
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,653  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:527
You could be flatter, Rose.
You've got a little bit
of a... chin poking out.

320
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,937  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:527
I'd rather die.
Honestly, it doesn't hurt.

321
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,170  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:504 Y2:523
I mean it. I would rather die.

322
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,412  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:474 Y2:527
It's better to die than to live
like you, a bitchy trampoline.

323
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,173  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:504 Y2:526
Oh, well, what do YOU know?

324
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,854  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:504 Y2:527
I was born on that planet.

325
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,173  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:527
And so was my mum, and so was my dad,
and that makes me, officially,
the last human being in this room.

326
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,369  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:527
Cos you're not human. You've had it
all nipped and tucked and flattened
till there's nothing left.

327
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,659  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:527
Anything human got chucked
in the bin. You're just skin,
Cassandra, lipstick and skin.

328
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,219  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:504 Y2:527
Nice talking.

329
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,650  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:527
So, tell me, Jabe,
what's a tree like you
doing in a place like this?

330
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,256  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
Respect for the Earth.
Oh, come on, everyone on
this Platform's worth zillions.

331
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,572  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:474 Y2:527
Well. Perhaps it's a case of having
to be seen at the right occasions.

332
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,132  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:527
In case your share prices drop?
I know you lot, you've got massive
forests, roots everywhere.

333
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:22,136  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:527
And there's always money in land.
All the same, we respect the Earth
as family.

334
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,452  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:474 Y2:527
So many species evolved from
that planet. Mankind is only one.

335
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,092  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:526
I'm another. My ancestors were
transplanted from the planet down
below, and I'm a direct descendant

336
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,057  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:504 Y2:527
of the tropical rainforest.

337
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,573  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:504 Y2:523
Excuse me.

338
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,977  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:474 Y2:523
And what about your ancestry,
Doctor?

339
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,288  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:474 Y2:527
Perhaps you could tell
a story or two.

340
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,659  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:474 Y2:527
Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble
when there's nothing else left...?

341
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,331  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:504 Y2:527
I scanned you earlier.

342
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,379  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:474 Y2:527
The metalmachine had trouble
identifying your species.

343
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,735  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:504 Y2:527
It refused to admit your existence.

344
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,210  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:474 Y2:523
And even when it named you,
I wouldn't believe it.

345
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,178  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:504 Y2:527
But it was right.

346
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,569  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:504 Y2:527
I know where you're from!

347
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,931  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:474 Y2:527
Forgive me for intruding, but
it's remarkable that you even exist.

348
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,976  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:504 Y2:527
I just want to say...

349
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,931  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:504 Y2:527
how sorry I am.

350
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,420  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:504 Y2:523
SLOW CHUFFING

351
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,291  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:504 Y2:527
Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?

352
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,290  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:504 Y2:523
SHE CRIES OUT

353
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,456  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:523
Fair do's though - that's a great
bit of air-conditioning. Sort of
nice and old-fashioned.

354
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,576  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:504 Y2:527
Bet they call it retro.

355
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,013  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:504 Y2:523
Gotcha.

356
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,292  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:527
What the hell's that?
Is it part of the "retro"?

357
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,496  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:504 Y2:526
I don't think so, hold on.

358
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,259  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:504 Y2:527
Hey, nice liana. Thank you.

359
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,331  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:504 Y2:527
Not supposed to show them in public.

360
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,411  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:504 Y2:527
Don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

361
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,493  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:527
Now then, who's been bringing their
pets on board? What does it do?

362
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,697  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:523
Sabotage...
'Earth-death in ten minutes... '

363
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,456  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
And the temperature's
about to rocket. Come on.
'... Earth death in ten minutes.'

364
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,496  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:504 Y2:527
The planet's end!

365
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,969  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:504 Y2:527
Come gather, come gather!

366
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,939  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:474 Y2:523
Bid farewell to the cradle
of civilisation.

367
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,410  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:523
Let us mourn her
with a traditional ballad.

368
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,890  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:474 Y2:527
INTRO TO: "Toxic"
sung by Britney Spears

369
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,814  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:527
# Baby, can't you see
I'm calling

370
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,858  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:474 Y2:527
# A guy like you
Should wear a warning

371
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,091  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:474 Y2:523
# It's dangerous
I'm fallin'... #

372
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,650  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:474 Y2:527
SQUEAKS AND TRILLS
All right, hold on, get back.

373
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,495  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:474 Y2:527
'Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising.'

374
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,811  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:474 Y2:523
Is the Steward in there?
You can smell him.

375
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,576  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:474 Y2:527
Hold on. There's another sunfilter
programmed to descend.

376
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,538  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:474 Y2:523
#... Too high
Can't come down

377
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,019  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:474 Y2:527
# Losing my head
Spinning round and round

378
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,780  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:504 Y2:527
# Do you feel me now...? #

379
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,217  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:527
'Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

380
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,058  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:504 Y2:527
'Sunfilter descending... '

381
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,099  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:474 Y2:527
Let me out! Let me out!
'... Sunfilter descending... '

382
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,057  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:504 Y2:523
LOUD BANGING

383
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,449  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:504 Y2:523
Let me out! Let me out!

384
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,692  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

385
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,418  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:474 Y2:527
MORE BANGING
Anyone in there?

386
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,415  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:474 Y2:527
Let me out! Oh, well,
it would be you(!) Open the door!

387
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,853  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:504 Y2:523
Give us two ticks...

388
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,899  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending... '

389
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,131  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:504 Y2:527
'Sunfilter rising. Sunfilter rising.

390
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,290  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:527
'Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising... '

391
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,338  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Sunfilter rising.
Sunfilter rising... '

392
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,369  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:527
'Sunfilter descending... '
Just what we need -
the computer's getting clever.

393
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,339  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:474 Y2:527
Stop mucking about! I'm not mucking
about! It's fighting back.

394
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,537  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Sunfilter descending... '
Open the door! I know!

395
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,499  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:474 Y2:523
'... Sunfilter descending... '
The lock's melted!

396
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,210  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Sunfilter descending.
Sunfilter descending.

397
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,289  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:474 Y2:527
'Sunfilter rising.

398
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,133  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:527
The whole thing's
jammed. I can't open the door.
Stay there, don't move.

399
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,858  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:504 Y2:527
Where am I gonna go - Ipswich(?)

400
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,931  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:504 Y2:523
'Earth-death in five minutes.'

401
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,296  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
The metalmachine confirms.
The spider devices have infiltrated
the whole of Platform One.

402
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,214  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:474 Y2:527
How's that possible? Our private
rooms are protected by a codewall.

403
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,370  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:504 Y2:527
(Moisturise me, moisturise me!)

404
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,419  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:474 Y2:523
Summon the Steward! I'm afraid the
Steward is dead.

405
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,094  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:504 Y2:523
THEY GASP AND MURMUR

406
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,137  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:504 Y2:523
Who killed him?

407
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,896  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:526
This whole event was sponsored
by the Face of Boe. He invited us.
Talk to the Face, talk to the Face!

408
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,734  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:474 Y2:527
Easy way of finding out. Someone
brought their little pet on board.

409
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,458  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:504 Y2:523
Let's send him back to master.

410
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,094  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:474 Y2:523
The Adherents of the Repeated Meme!
J'accuse!

411
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,493  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:527
That's all very well,
and really kind of obvious but,
if you stop and think about it...

412
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,648  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:504 Y2:527
A repeated meme is just an idea.

413
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,732  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:504 Y2:527
And that's all they are, an idea.

414
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,819  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:523
Remote-control 'droids. Nice little
cover for the real troublemaker.

415
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,334  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:504 Y2:526
Go on, Jimbo. Go home.

416
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,251  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:504 Y2:523
GUESTS GASP

417
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,377  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:474 Y2:527
I bet you were the school swot
and never got kissed.

418
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,779  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:504 Y2:523
At arms!

419
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,498  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:504 Y2:527
What you gonna do, moisturise me?

420
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,013  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:504 Y2:523
With acid.

421
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,252  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, you're too late, anyway.
My spiders have control
of the mainframe.

422
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,619  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oh, you all carried them as gifts,
tax-free, past every codewall.

423
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,218  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:527
I'm not just a pretty face.
Sabotaging a ship while you're
inside it, how stupid's that?

424
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,337  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:474 Y2:527
I'd hoped to manufacture
a hostage situation.

425
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,050  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
With myself as one of the victims,
the compensation
would have been enormous.

426
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,610  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:474 Y2:527
Five billion years,
and it still comes down to money.

427
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,533  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:474 Y2:527
D'you think it's cheap,
looking like this?

428
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,418  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:504 Y2:523
Flatness costs a fortune!

429
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,809  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:504 Y2:526
I am the Last Human, Doctor.

430
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,576  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:474 Y2:527
Me, not that freaky little kid
of yours.

431
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,855  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:504 Y2:523
Arrest her! The infidel!

432
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,218  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:474 Y2:527
Oh, shut it, pixie!
I've still got my final option.

433
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,530  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:474 Y2:523
'Earth-death in three minutes,
Earth-death in three minutes... '

434
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,408  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:474 Y2:527
And here it comes. You're
just as useful dead, all of you.

435
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,449  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:527
I have shares in
your rival companies. They'll triple

436
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,533  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:527
My spiders are primed and ready
to destroy the safety systems.

437
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,850  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:504 Y2:527
How did that old Earth song go?

438
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,578  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:504 Y2:527
"Burn baby, burn."

439
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,457  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:504 Y2:527
Then you'll burn with us!

440
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,656  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:504 Y2:527

441
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,495  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:474 Y2:527

strictly forbidden, but...

442
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,377  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:504 Y2:527
I'm such a naughty thing.

448
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:44,334  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:474 Y2:527

452
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,257  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:526
No, we can do it by hand.
There must be a "system restore"
switch. Jabe, come on.

00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:06,974  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:527
Me too. Right, then. Before
you get me back in that box, chips
it is. And you can pay. No money.

551
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,689  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:474 Y2:527
What sort of date are you? Come on,
then, tightwad. Chips are on me.

552
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,659  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:474 Y2:527
We've only got five billion years
till the shops close.

553
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,297  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:476 Y2:529
Now - you've seen the future,
so let's have a look at the past.

554
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,408  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
1860, how does 1860 sound?
What happened in 1860?
I don't know. Let's find out.

555
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,894  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:527
..I can't believe she's gone.
Not gone, Mr Redpath, sir.
Merely sleeping.

556
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,258  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:527
She's up and on her feet and out
there somewhere. Mr Sneed for shame,
how many more times? It's ungodly!

557
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,377  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:474 Y2:527
'... Excuse me, sir.
Mr Dickens, this is your call.'

558
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,090  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:474 Y2:527
..Use the sight. Find the old lady
or you're dismissed.

559
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,614  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:504 Y2:527
What phantasmagoria is this?

560
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,413  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:504 Y2:523
That's more like it!
