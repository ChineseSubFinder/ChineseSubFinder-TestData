1
00:00:00,977 --> 00:00:02,210
Previously on "Criminal Minds"...

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:03,478
We're taking you home.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,879
Garcia: Do you really
think that he can handle it,

4
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:06,514
I mean, all that Reid's been through?

5
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,082
We all know what that can
do to the psyche of an inmate.

6
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,653
Scratch has surfaced again,

7
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,421
this time at Jack's school,

8
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:16,124
which is why Hotch and Jack
have now entered the program.

9
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:17,392
Witness protection.

10
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:19,327
We might have a new lead on Mr. Scratch.

11
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:22,133
***{\a6}

12
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,139
This text, it's a trap. Let's go.

13
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:39,439
Guys?

14
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,360
Guys?

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,897
Don't go to voice mail.
Don't go to voice mail.

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,931
Don't go to voice mail.

17
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:52,113
This
is SSA Emily Prentiss.
I can't take your call right now, so...

18
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,281
Hey, I came as soon as I could.

19
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:57,985
- What's wrong?
- They're gone.

20
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:00,833
They're all gone.

21
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,492
- I'll drive.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,762
Correct. Penelope Grace Garcia,

23
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,464
technical analyst, badge number 0019er0.

24
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,832
I am with international response team

25
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,334
special agent Matt Simmons.

26
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:15,670
Yeah. I know, but SSA Spencer Reid

27
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:18,105
hasn't been reinstated yet, so...

28
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,740
Oh, my god, I know this is protocol,

29
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,508
but you need to stop asking me questions

30
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,712
and send backup to the coordinates
I just gave you right now, please...

31
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:32,286
And medical.

32
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:34,021
Send lots of medical.

33
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,589
No, no...

34
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,725
Ok. Come on. I got you. I
got you. I got you. I got you.

35
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,460
Jag-off ambushed us,

36
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:41,095
didn't even see him coming.

37
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,930
All right. We got to
get you off that leg, ok?

38
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,532
No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

39
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,535
I'll flag down the cavalry.

40
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:49,336
You go check on the team.

41
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:50,571
Yes, the team,

42
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,772
the team, the team.

43
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,374
- What can I do?
- I can't see.

44
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:54,475
What can I do? How can I help?

45
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,810
I can't see. Ugh!

46
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:58,245
Wait. All right. I see it, ok? I see it.

47
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:02,116
You got some broken glass
in your scalp, JJ, ok?

48
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:05,152
Just hold this till the
ambulance comes, all right?

49
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,656
- It'll be here soon.
- Stephen?

50
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,758
Stephen?

51
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:22,002
He's gone. He's gone.

52
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:25,940
I can't leave him alone like this.

53
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:29,710
Luke! Luke!

54
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:34,281
Tara, can you tell me where you're hurt?

55
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,118
Um, I think I'm going into shock.

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,086
Ok. All right. I got you.

57
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,921
Tara, we're gonna
warm you up, all right?

58
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:43,124
Bleeding internally, but we'll get
some blood to your brain.

59
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:44,291
All right. Listen.

60
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,760
You're gonna want to go to sleep.

61
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,794
We can't let you do that.
You got to stay with us, ok?

62
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:49,530
Stay with us. Over here!

63
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:56,103
Those spike strips took out
our two SUVs.

64
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,439
Then the truck blindsided us.

65
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,776
We have 6 agents that are...

66
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,483
Where's Emily?

67
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,201
Where am I?

68
00:03:27,203 --> 00:03:30,504
You were in a car crash, a bad one.

69
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,709
Oh, my god, what happened?

70
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,345
Your SUV sustained the
brunt of the impact.

71
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:41,081
Specifically, you sustained it.

72
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,085
Do you remember?

73
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:47,122
No. I...

74
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,829
Wait. Yeah. My team.

75
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:57,464
Take... take it easy, Agent Prentiss.

76
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,400
Got you stabilized,
but you got to stay put.

77
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,936
Where am I? This isn't a hospital.

78
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:03,871
I've been in enough hospitals.

79
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:07,408
I know how they sound, how they smell,

80
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,377
so where the hell am I?

81
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,647
You're being taken care of.

82
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,816
We both are.

83
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:18,552
Wait. What... what does that mean?

84
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:20,654
I don't understand you.

85
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:23,123
Yeah. She's conscious.

86
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,568
Well, hello, Emily.

87
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:37,905
Son of a bitch.

88
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,241
It's nice to meet you, too, finally.

89
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:42,776
Did you grab all of us, huh?

90
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:45,379
Are we all here? Luke! JJ!

91
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,815
No. It's just you.

92
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,451
Your team is fine, by the way.

93
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,954
Excuse me. I take that back.

94
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:57,057
The truck I drove into your team

95
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:00,628
did kill SSA Stephen Walker...

96
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,964
Whiplash, tragic, leaves behind a wife

97
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,433
and two children, I believe.

98
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:09,370
- No.
- That's good.

99
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:12,373
Get it all out.

100
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,043
I will make sure you fry for this.

101
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:17,978
Will you?

102
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,914
Well, maybe you should take a look

103
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,450
at yourself first...

104
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,658
Because from where I'm standing,

105
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,193
you won't be doing much of anything

106
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:36,394
for the rest of your life.

I'm...

115
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:34,731
I need to call Will.

116
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,276
I did. I did. He's on the way.

117
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:40,379
Right. Right.

118
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:41,975
Oh, Monica,

119
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:44,586
Stephen's wife.

120
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,803
Someone needs to call her and tell them.

121
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:55,033
Rossi's refusing treatment
until he speaks to both of us.

122
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:02,918
What's going on?

123
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,987
Shut up and listen. All right.

124
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:10,459
First, you, go through my pants pockets
and find my keys.

125
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,562
Second, you, you're back on the team.

126
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:15,197
Not sure I should be.

127
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,332
Has the director approved that?

128
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:17,933
I'm making the calls now.

129
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,402
I'll take the heat.
You're back on the team.

130
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,470
I got them.

131
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:23,372
There's a little one there

132
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,774
to a file cabinet in my office.

133
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:26,909
You following me?

134
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,444
Yeah. Following you.

135
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:31,714
Inside, there's Chicago
Bears season tickets.

136
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,918
When you get them,
you call Matt Simmons.

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,454
I promised him those tickets.

138
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:42,124
They must have given him something

139
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,592
in the ambulance to make him loopy.

140
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:45,594
I'll get the doctor.
We'll get him into surgery.

141
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,263
Just shut up and listen.

142
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,100
Now, Emily is missing. Stephen is dead.

143
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,068
As for you two ass clowns,

144
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,538
you'll do me the courtesy
of following my orders.

145
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
Your orders aren't making sense.

146
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:04,346
Follow my orders,
and then I'll go into surgery.

147
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,519
This has got nothing to
do with season tickets.

148
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,754
"Ass clown"?

149
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,489
So Scratch hacked my phone tonight

150
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,524
using something called a
man in the middle attack.

151
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:17,493
That means he's on a
specific radio frequency.

152
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,927
And you're thinking he's using the same

153
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,996
radio frequency to
activate these spikes.

154
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,231
Well, he is a man of habit.

155
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,233
Maybe we can use that
habit to locate him

156
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,968
and figure out...

157
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,236
This is how I profile.

158
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:31,173
Oh, oh, oh. Hold. Freeze. Freeze.

159
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,975
You just hit it. Hold on.

160
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:35,477
All right. Back it up.

161
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:40,349
Booyah.

162
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:41,450
Now we got the frequency.

163
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:42,651
We just have to figure out

164
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:43,986
where he's broadcasting it from.

165
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,521
Ok. That is easier said than done.

166
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,156
Radio signals work on a preset range.

167
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,325
We'll walk or drive in
and out of proximity to it.

168
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,660
And he could be bouncing it
off multiple buildings.

169
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:52,895
Yeah. That's also true.

170
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:54,596
Ok. The least I could
do is make sure Scratch

171
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,432
doesn't ambush us again, so
the next time he goes live,

172
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,535
I'll set up some sort of signal, like...

173
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:01,510
***

174
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:07,209
They have to take
him to the hospital, anyway?

175
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:10,646
Yeah. That's the proper procedure.

176
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,506
Need a minute?

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,154
So, so badly, but...

178
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:22,358
We have to help Emily.

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Let's get to work.

180
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,532
Taking a
little mindfulness break?

181
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,198
Trying to control your breathing?

182
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,594
That's smart.

183
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,762
It'll keep you sane...

184
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,299
And I need you sane.

185
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:48,470
Oh, how rude. Excuse me.

186
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,939
Look. I'm only alive
because you want something.

187
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,407
So what do you want?

188
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:55,010
Information that only you have.

189
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,411
What are you waiting for, then?

190
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,780
Dose me with your drugs,
the ones that make me see

191
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:00,248
whatever delusion you suggest,

192
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,584
and I'll tell you what you want.

193
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:06,521
Hmm, I would love
nothing more than that.

194
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,758
Unfortunately,
in your current physical condition,

195
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,693
the sevoflurane and scopolamine

196
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,496
would send you into a stroke.

197
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,031
I guess we're at a stalemate, then.

198
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,166
No. I still have drugs
that can make you talk,

199
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:21,569
just different drugs.

200
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,710
This is morphine.

201
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,147
This is what is making your life

202
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,749
very livable right now.

203
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:38,353
Without this...

204
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,158
Your body will be on fire,

205
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,160
and then you really will tell me

206
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:49,397
everything I want,
no delusion necessary.

207
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,641
I can't arrest him.

208
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:01,042
- What?
- Scratch.

209
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,243
The second I see his face,

210
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,710
I am going to kill him.

211
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,714
I tried to tell Rossi not
to put me back on the team.

212
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:10,085
- You heard me.
- Yeah. I did.

213
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,555
What's wrong with me?

214
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:16,224
My guess is, it's been
going on since prison,

215
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,660
but you haven't had time to notice.

216
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,096
Every time you get stressed,
you go into tunnel vision.

217
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,865
That's why you're rubbing
your palm into your eye.

218
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:26,501
Yeah. What does that sound like, Reid?

219
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,137
- Sounds like PTSD.
- PTSS.

220
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,905
That's what they're calling it now,

221
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,874
post-traumatic stress syndrome,

222
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:35,510
because it's not a disorder.

223
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,612
It's an injury.

224
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,482
Well, what do I do? I
mean, we're in crisis mode.

225
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:42,350
I don't have time to
process my emotional state.

226
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,919
That's exactly when
you make time, right?

227
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,154
You ask for help.

228
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,789
There's no shame in that.

229
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,923
- Rossi's office.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,158
- I'll handle that.
- No.

231
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,461
There's someone in Rossi's office.

232
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,977
Ok. Now that we are secure,

233
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,179
I got that for Rossi last year.

234
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:12,647
Not only is it a cigar case,

235
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,048
but it's also a Faraday case.

236
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,618
It blocks all radio and cell signals.

237
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,487
I think Scratch might
be listening in on us

238
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,490
with our cell phones,
even when they're off.

239
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,293
That explains why Rossi was
so cagey in the hospital.

240
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:28,897
All right. Let's find these tickets.

241
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,009
What is this?

242
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,111
Stephen was brought on board
for one reason.

243
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:44,946
That was to catch Scratch.

244
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,814
That is his entire
investigation into him.

245
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,316
He kept all
his records off site,

246
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:50,852
updating Prentiss and
Rossi through hard copies.

247
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,120
If it's off the
cloud, Scratch can't hack it.

248
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,588
- Have you guys read it?
- No.

249
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,056
Prentiss ordered it compartmentalized,

250
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:56,424
eyes-only clearance, but she also felt

251
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:59,594
there should be at least one failsafe
who wasn't part of the BAU

252
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,996
who knew about it just
in case of emergency.

253
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,464
That's why Garcia called me.

254
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:04,999
All right. Let's dig in.

255
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,726
I mean, this may be our only chance
at stopping this bastard.

256
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,315
Look. Ok. Look. Ok.

257
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,850
Whatever it is, we can discuss it.

258
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:26,321
You don't have to do this.

259
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:28,756
Just give me the morphine, ok,

260
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,658
and... and... just...

261
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,560
You can ask whatever you want.

262
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,630
It was our investigation
into you? Is that it?

263
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,298
Is that what you want to know?

264
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,566
Tangentially.

265
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,736
Oh! Nngh! Then what?

266
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,205
Tell me. Tell me. Then I'll tell you.

267
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,074
It's that simple.

268
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,843
Tell me, and I'll tell you.

269
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:54,849
Yeah. I believe you will now.

270
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,853
There is a certain
dearly departed team member of yours

271
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:01,756
that I would like to discuss with you.

272
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:07,028
- Stephen.
- No, not Stephen.

273
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,733
This one isn't dead, at least not yet.

274
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,602
This agent and I had
a little tete-a-tete,

275
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,439
and I crossed a line I shouldn't have.

276
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,676
I really couldn't help myself,

277
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:25,813
and I started to stalk his son,

278
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,449
and do you know what he did,

279
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,152
that coward?

280
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,621
He went into witness protection...

281
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:39,427
And he has been very difficult to find
ever since,

282
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,430
so that's what I want to know.

283
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:47,001
I want you to tell me where he is
because I know you know.

284
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,671
No.

285
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:52,073
Oh, stop. No.

286
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:55,610
Yes, Emily.

287
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:58,713
Where is Aaron Hotchner?

288
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:07,143
I don't know where Hotch is.

289
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,611
I don't.

290
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,112
That's how WITSEC works.

291
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,348
He has to be hidden from us

292
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,684
because of men like you.

293
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:16,619
Do you recognize this?

294
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,120
Well, it was a text exchange you had

295
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:20,089
with a series of burner phones,

296
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,958
and a last text exchange between you

297
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,793
and this mystery man reads,

298
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,062
"Honduras connection is a go.

299
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,932
"Hunting down all
leads to B-cap in DC.

300
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,467
Thanks. A.H."

301
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:40,176
Let's get down to the question at hand.

302
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:41,510
Where is Hotch?

303
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,145
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

304
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:45,147
He never gave me an
address. All we did was text.

305
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,550
No. Last chance.

306
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,652
Vermont.

307
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:51,821
He's somewhere in Vermont.

308
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:03,733
Hi. I'm sorry.

309
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,071
You don't want to do that, Monica.

310
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:13,075
Ok. I'll come get you now.

311
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:16,646
Stephen's wife?

312
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,582
Tell her I'm sorry.

313
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,997
Prentiss texted Hotch?

314
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,099
According to Stephen's
documentation, yes.

315
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,935
It must have been a coordinated attempt
to share intel.

316
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:41,704
Would Hotch have exposed
himself like this?

317
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,840
No, and neither would she.
I mean, she wouldn't
rely on a hackable app,

318
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,809
and she sure as hell wouldn't
write, "A.H.," in a text.

319
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:48,044
That defeats the purpose

320
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,512
of compartmentalizing the investigation.

321
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,080
It was a smoke screen.

322
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:52,615
Stephen had a background
in counterintelligence.

323
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,916
He must have designed this.

324
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:57,219
He faked the Hotch
side of the conversation
to entice Scratch to make a move.

325
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,188
The size and scale of
which indicate desperation,

326
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,525
a desperation he hasn't shown
after a year of hiding, so why now?

327
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:03,893
A.H. is a pretty big red flag.

328
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,194
Maybe that's what brought him out.

329
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:08,664
Well, they used Hotch's initials
in other texts before.

330
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,932
Then they found something else,

331
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,934
something they knew would rattle him.

332
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:14,203
B-cap.
What's B-cap?

333
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,571
Geography maybe.

334
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,239
I mean, it's mentioned
in relevance to DC.

335
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,575
Maybe its a
code name for a partner.

336
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,812
- I can't see it.
- Hey, no.

337
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,180
Why don't we kick it over to the team?

338
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:25,247
Maybe they can suss out...

339
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,549
No. No time. Get out.

340
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,850
What? Get out. Sorry.

341
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:29,218
You, too. I'm really sorry, but get out.

342
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,219
Let me get this,
and then I'm gonna go.

343
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:31,854
It's ok. Ok.

344
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:37,460
He's had a rough couple of months.

345
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,975
Oh, my god, babe.

346
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,410
Oh, how are the kids?

347
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,078
Oh, they're fine. They're fine.

348
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,848
I didn't even wake them.
I got your mom to come over.

349
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,617
- Oh, right.
- Look at me.

350
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,086
How are you?

351
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,359
Um, he... he gave me the front seat.

352
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:13,329
Stephen did?

353
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:16,665
Yeah. I was all set to sit in the back,

354
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,034
but he got there first, and I...

355
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:25,608
So is it time to call it?

356
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,210
That was the deal, right?

357
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,312
If it got too scary,
one of us could call it,

358
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:32,882
not today, not this
week after we find Emily.

359
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:35,351
Well, if I remember,

360
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,720
you would be a full-time mom,

361
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,122
and I would run a breakfast place.

362
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:43,092
Mm, and I'd go to all the PTA meetings.

363
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:45,795
You'd come home smelling like grease.

364
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,697
It's tempting.

365
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:51,801
Hmm, yeah,

366
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:56,338
so do you want to call it?

367
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:01,410
You see these rings?

368
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:03,446
We've worn them for 5 years,

369
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:05,981
but I've loved you for 10.

370
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,516
Hasn't been easy.

371
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:10,453
No, but I wouldn't trade a single day,

372
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:14,723
not even the awful ones like today...

373
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,564
And I'll do whatever
you want to do, but...

374
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,332
Oh, thank god.

375
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,301
Neither do I.

376
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,905
Get a room, you two.

377
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:32,107
Is my leg still attached?

378
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,009
Yeah.

379
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:38,414
- Is Prentiss...
- Nothing.

380
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:48,390
All right. I got to go. Luke's here.

381
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:57,566
- Oh, Monica...
- Don't.

382
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,003
I can't.

383
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:03,339
Where's my husband?

384
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,974
Oh, babe, what happened?

385
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,523
The kids are still asleep.

386
00:20:57,228 --> 00:21:00,296
How do I...

387
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:14,376
I'll take care of it, ok?

388
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,519
See you.

389
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:52,214
Where is that place that you go to

390
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:53,983
to ground yourself?

391
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:56,885
I'd like to know.

392
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,723
So you can destroy it.

393
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,593
See, I've read your case file.

394
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:07,496
I've read about how
your father was killed

395
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,566
when you were 13, and earlier,

396
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:13,802
you said something about crossing a line

397
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:17,573
when it came to stalking a child.

398
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:22,211
I realized Hotch's son Jack,

399
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:25,581
he's 13 now, too.

400
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,851
I'm not a pedophile.

401
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,153
I'm insulted by your inference.

402
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:36,225
No. Your interest in Jack is clinical.

403
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:40,295
You want to see what it will be like

404
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:44,099
if he grows up without
his father like you did.

405
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,835
That's what I've been focusing on.

406
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:49,371
After you kill Hotch,

407
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:54,143
you'll never leave Jack alone.
Am I right?

408
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:56,145
You are.

409
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,948
Then let me tell you something, Peter.

410
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,253
I've died before protecting a child.

411
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:07,489
That was a child I barely knew,

412
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:12,861
but Jack, I love Jack.

413
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:16,198
I've watched Jack grow up.

414
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,468
I will not betray him or his father,

415
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,738
so it doesn't matter what you do to me.

416
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,441
I will not break.

417
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:30,345
Let me test that resolve.

418
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:50,265
You make an interesting point.

419
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,168
I need a plan "B."

420
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:09,585
Hey, you, come here...

421
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,856
Just for a second.

422
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:16,291
Please, I just need a second.

423
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:22,531
This I might be able to help with.

424
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,067
Prentiss' last text
had to do with Honduras.

425
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:28,137
Scratch's last known
sighting before tonight
was Honduras.

426
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,606
Right, and we thought Scratch fled there

427
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,975
after he framed Reid
for murder in Mexico.

428
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:34,710
Right. Prentiss asked the IRT to contact

429
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:38,046
our central American sources just to see
if we could find anything.

430
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:39,481
Now, we never did.

431
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,216
We also never stopped to ask why Scratch

432
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,886
was in Honduras in the first place.

433
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:45,954
Reid'll figure this out.

434
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:47,589
He's really amazing
at this kind of thing.

435
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:56,832
B-cap is short for Banisters caapi.

436
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,134
It's a plant, specifically
a hallucinogen that's found

437
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,669
in a tea called ayahuasca.

438
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:01,870
We worked a couple of
those cases, I think.

439
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,918
If I remember, it's like peyote.

440
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:05,393
Yeah, in multiple ways.

441
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:07,195
They're similar legally
in that taking them

442
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,796
is considered a religious practice,

443
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,531
and pharmacological,
they're similar in that

444
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,367
both drugs cause you to hallucinate

445
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,268
intense, geometric
patterns and vomit a lot.

446
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,004
Ok. What does this
have to do with Scratch?

447
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:17,939
Well, Scratch has a cocktail
of disassociative drugs

448
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,674
to induce delusions,
but a mathematical mind

449
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:22,110
like his would always
be looking for ways
to tweak and improve the formula.

450
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:23,845
So he went to Honduras to look for it.

451
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:26,047
He then brought it back to
DC to experiment with it.

452
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,216
Stephen and Emily came
to the same conclusion

453
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,652
and tried to pretend like
they were hot on his trail.

454
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,454
We need to track down all practitioners
of the ceremony in the district...

455
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:35,323
Shamans, gurus, overnight religions

456
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,591
that just hung their first shingle.

457
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:38,092
He could be using one
of their volunteers

458
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:41,529
as a partner, either
witting or unwitting.

459
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,166
What?

460
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,202
You threw a book at a
window. It was jarring.

461
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,771
Took me 60 minutes to deduce

462
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,205
what should have taken me 60 seconds,

463
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,441
and if Emily dies
because I was too slow,

464
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:55,749
I'll be throwing a lot more than books.

465
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:03,785
Please. Please help me.

466
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:06,120
You don't even have
to get me out of here.

467
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:08,790
Just make a phone call.
You can use my phone.

468
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:11,693
Call 911, leave the phone, and run.

469
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,327
I can't do that.

470
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,029
I won't tell them you were involved.

471
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,464
It's not that simple.

472
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:18,566
You said we were both
being taken care of.

473
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:20,468
You mean trapped.

474
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,805
He has your family, doesn't he?

475
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:26,107
Ok. My team can rescue them.

476
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,608
It's what we do.

477
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,877
- I have to go.
- No. Please.

478
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,414
- I can't.
- Take my phone.

479
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,783
Please take my phone.

480
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:41,055
It's so hard to find
good help these days.

481
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,157
It seems like, no matter what,

482
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,660
I'm left to do all the dirty work.

483
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:47,862
What is that?

484
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:50,498
Is that the morphine?

485
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,133
It's amphetamine.

486
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:53,935
I figured out my plan "B."

487
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:55,837
I can't torture the answers out of you,

488
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,139
so I'll simply stop your heart instead.

489
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,819
If you want to live,

490
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,888
tell me what I want to know.

491
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,356
Where's Hotch, Emily?

492
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:19,827
Where's Hotch?

493
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,608
Come on.

494
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:16,085
*

495
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:23,175
Of course.

496
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:26,278
I get it now.

497
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,413
I get it.

498
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,152
That's it.

499
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,962
Please,

500
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:46,264
tell him what he wants.

501
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,300
If you tell him what he wants,

502
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,035
this can all be over.

503
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,671
He'll release my family, and...

504
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:55,574
And then I can help you, ok?

505
00:28:58,078 --> 00:29:00,445
What? What's that?

506
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,049
Go get him.

507
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:10,922
Ok, so apparently,
the only local place

508
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:13,959
using b-cap is the church
of the herbal sacrament,

509
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,660
"where you can find everything

510
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:20,098
"for your spiritual needs
that only ayahuasca can fulfill."

511
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,200
Walk me through what's gonna
happen when we get there.

512
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:23,868
We ask questions, and we come home.

513
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,837
No creepy weirdness?

514
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,306
No weirdness.

515
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,408
Good because I'm about full up

516
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,357
in the creepy weirdness
department for one night.

517
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:41,486
I've seen the face of God.

518
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,622
I've seen it.

519
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:47,425
So much for no creepy weirdness.

520
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:56,268
Scratch's radio signal.

521
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,453
Clear. Come on in.

522
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:25,563
Mother lode.

523
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:29,801
Yeah. Looks like we found Scratch's
I.T. department, no Scratch.

524
00:30:29,803 --> 00:30:33,338
Yeah, but this is where
he's been doing everything...

525
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,008
Hacking me, hacking our phones,

526
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,077
the whole tamale...

527
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,147
And, just like you predicted,

528
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,648
he's been bouncing the signal

529
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,216
off multiple buildings.

530
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,484
We're close, Matt.

531
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,691
They sent me to talk
some sense into you.

532
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:54,192
Can't help by lying down,

533
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:55,927
and I hear Tara's waking up.

534
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,630
Do you... do you
want me to find you
some crutches or something?

535
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,999
I don't need them. I got you.

536
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:05,337
Scratch. Scratch took Emily.

537
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,072
I saw him. Yeah. We know.

538
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,106
We're looking for him.

539
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:10,475
He dosed her.

540
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:13,311
In the SUV while she was knocked out?

541
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah.

542
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,983
He
brought his gas with him.

543
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,788
Your legs are broken.

544
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,490
Your right arm is broken.

545
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,727
You're in severe traction,
and you're paralyzed.

546
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,595
You feel unimaginable agony

547
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,299
all over your body unless I give you
high doses of painkiller.

548
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:38,236
She would wake in a delusion
he'd have total control over.

549
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:41,473
He think she knows where Hotch is,
so he's trying to trick her.

550
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:42,707
She's one of the
smartest people we know.

551
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:43,908
She'd see through it.

552
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,677
So Scratch would go even farther.

553
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,912
Sometimes interrogators
even simulate death.

554
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,048
Man, he could make it feel
like the real thing.

555
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,583
No. That wouldn't work.

556
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:53,551
Remember, Rossi, when Prentiss
told us about when she died,

557
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:55,787
for real died, how for her,

558
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,322
it was just dark and cold?

559
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:58,757
That's right.

560
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,392
If he made her experience some

561
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:03,361
out-of-body vision,
she'd know it was a lie.

562
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:42,934
Yeah. I get it.

563
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:44,736
Jareau, voice-over: He
probably combined the delusion

564
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:47,605
with a classic prisoner
interrogation tactic.

565
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,974
At first, he would take
away any chance of escape.

566
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:53,044
Then he would introduce somebody else
and give her a sliver of hope.

567
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:56,247
It could
be a second interrogator
who is a nice guy.

568
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,550
He's on his way, ok?

569
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:00,652
That
guy would be her blind spot.

570
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,888
She'd trust him and then
reveal something she shouldn't.

571
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,558
Ok? Ok?

572
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,527
Ok?

573
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:13,231
Yeah. Yeah. Ok.

574
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:22,140
Hey, what do you got, Matt?

575
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,441
Simmons, on phone: Well,
we pinned down Scratch's

576
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,076
most likely location based
on his radio frequency.

577
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:26,511
It's a warehouse in the district.

578
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:28,112
Garcia just texted the address.

579
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:32,283
She included Reid on the text.

580
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,752
Reid's not in a good place.

581
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:35,753
I'm 10 out.

582
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:37,455
All right. So am I.

583
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:45,497
If I would've known that putting you

584
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,765
at death's door would get you to talk,

585
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,968
I would've started with that.

586
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,206
Now, are you ready to tell me
where Hotch and Jack are?

587
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:59,244
Good. Go ahead.

588
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,913
They're at...

589
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,683
Tell me.

590
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:09,854
8... 5...

591
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:36,944
FBI!

592
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,067
Prentiss! Reid!

593
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:14,291
Prentiss!

594
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,141
Lower your weapon, damn it.

595
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:32,276
Where's Scratch?

596
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:34,778
Oh, he's upstairs. Tag in here.

597
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,447
Simmons and Alvez can box him in.

598
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:37,448
No. I need to go find him.

599
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,118
No, no, no, Spence. Please.

600
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:42,157
I need someone I know is
real right now, all right?

601
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:46,090
You ok?

602
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:59,430
Help me, please. Help me.

603
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,302
Help me.

604
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:23,821
Scratch is down.
Repeat... Scratch is down.

605
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,036
He fell trying to escape.

606
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:02,159
We never get to
say good-bye the way we want,

607
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:06,563
and when we deal with a
loss so sudden and cruel,

608
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:09,633
our emotions can overwhelm us.

609
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:12,503
Stephen Walker was a good agent,

610
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:15,706
but he was a better man.

611
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:19,309
He made the world a better place,

612
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:23,313
and we can honor him by doing
the work he never got to do.

613
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:27,050
[Foy Vance's "Burden" playing]

614
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:40,430
*let me carry your burden *

615
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:47,938
*if something's not
right, I will let you know *

616
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:54,845
*like the paint that's drying
on a heart that's broke *

617
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:58,682
*let me carry your burden *

618
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:05,856
*get you back on a high
when you're feeling low *

619
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:10,861
*when the weight's too
heavy but you won't let go *

620
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:14,698
- There are no words.
- No.

621
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,900
There are not.

622
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:20,204
Monica, I asked Stephen to join the BAU.

623
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:22,472
I asked him to hunt Scratch.

624
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:24,508
I got him killed, and...

625
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,444
Peter Lewis killed my husband...

626
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:34,251
And I choose to believe
Stephen can rest

627
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:37,354
knowing he helped this team catch him.

628
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,725
Thank you.

629
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,360
If there's anything the Bureau can do

630
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:44,995
for you or your family, please...

631
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:47,464
I will.

632
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,199
Right now, my kids need me...

633
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:51,201
*pretty soon, I'll see you smile *

634
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:53,704
*and you know you will *

635
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,572
And your team needs you.

636
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:58,942
*oh, well, no matter how
much you're hurting right now *

637
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:02,512
*you know that everything
will change in time *

638
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:07,117
*oh, I just might
see it in another light *

639
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,754
*got no dog here in the fight *

640
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,789
*I could carry your
burden, o brother mine *

641
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,692
Ohh... Ok.

642
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:17,594
We're ok.

643
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,837
I wanted to thank you
for all of your help.

644
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,906
Well, it was good to be of help.

645
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:30,240
Ever since the IRT went down, I've been

646
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:32,276
sitting on my hands waiting
for a new assignment.

647
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:35,913
We should sit down tomorrow.
We can talk about that.

648
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:37,381
I'd like that.

649
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:39,716
So we all need to discuss

650
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:43,086
what Peter Lewis' death
means for this team.

651
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:46,056
It means that Hotch can come back.

652
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:48,926
Yeah. We spoke to him.

653
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:53,764
He was relieved that he and Jack
were out of danger.

654
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:57,601
They're out of Witness Protection,

655
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:59,603
but, um...

656
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:02,506
He's not coming back, is he?

657
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:06,543
He loves being a full-time dad.

658
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,178
He never got to do that before,

659
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,980
and... let's face it... in this job...

660
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:13,116
There's always gonna be another Scratch,

661
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:16,453
and he's lost enough.

662
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:19,022
We all have.

663
00:41:19,024 --> 00:41:23,393
Yes. We have, which is why
the director has ordered us

664
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,463
to take some time off
from handling cases,

665
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,865
but before we all leave,
there's one last thing

666
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:32,336
I need to say.

667
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:35,906
Scratch got deeper into my
head than I care to admit,

668
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:38,775
and the only way I was able to stay sane

669
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:42,646
was by repeating a mantra, two words.

670
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:45,582
You know what those two words were?

671
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:47,584
"Wheels up."

672
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,087
it saved my life when I
wasn't sure I was gonna make it

673
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:54,791
because it reminded me that
you were out there fighting,

674
00:41:54,793 --> 00:41:59,429
so take your rest... You've earned it...

675
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:02,532
But when we get back,

676
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:05,168
wheels up, Matt.

677
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,104
Wheels up, Emily.

678
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:09,406
Wheels up, Tara.

679
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:11,375
Wheels up.

680
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:13,377
Wheels up.

681
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:15,278
Wheels up.

682
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,214
Wheels up.

683
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:19,883
Damn right, wheels up.

684
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:25,555
Wheels up.
