1
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,678
非洲
Africa.

2
00:00:54,472 --> 00:01:00,228
这里拥有地球上最为雄浑壮丽的野生奇观
No continent on Earth today has such spectacular wildlife.

3
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:09,154
它的中心是郁郁葱葱的广阔热带雨林
At its heart lies a vast tropical rainforest.

4
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:17,454
超过200万平方公里的旷野，
Over a million square miles of wilderness,

5
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:25,000
其中大部分是仍未开发的原始森林
much of it still unexplored...
...even now.

6
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:32,552
这些丛林中有更多种类的动植物
There are more species of animals and plants in these jungles

7
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,679
比非洲大陆其他任何地方都重要
than anywhere else on the continent.

8
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:43,396
但是即使在这片土地上
But even in this land of plenty...

9
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,942
野生动物正在面临着许多严峻挑战
...wildlife now faces major challenges.

10
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,211
象牙海岸（科特迪瓦）的森林
The forests of the Ivory Coast

11
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:10,632
包含超过1,500种植物
contain over 1,500 species of plant,

12
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,635
但是有些资源很难获取
but some are very difficult to get at...

13
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,597
甚至是最聪明的动物之一
...even for one of the most intelligent of animals.

14
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,317
黑猩猩
Chimpanzees.

15
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:46,251
这群中的长者知道哪里可以找到最营养的食物
The elders in this group know where to find the most nutritious food

16
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,921
以及如何提取其中的养分
and how to extract it.

17
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,509
这些年轻幼崽要生存到成年
But if they are to survive to adulthood,

18
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:58,888
必须向父母学习这些技能
the youngsters must learn these skills from their parents.

19
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,738
这个年轻的雌性五岁
This young female is five years old...

20
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,911
这个年纪，可以学到一堂重要的课
...old enough to be given an important lesson.

21
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,471
这是传授知识的老师
And this is her teacher.

22
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,266
她妈妈
Her mother.

23
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,276
该课程是如何破解坚果
The lesson is how to crack a nut.

24
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,625
熟练使用工具是一项复杂的技能
Using tools like this is so complex

25
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,421
目前仅由少数黑猩猩群体掌握
that it has only been mastered by a handful of chimpanzee communities.

26
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:28,019
这是黑猩猩已经实践了数千年的技能
This is a skill that has been practised by chimps for several thousand years.

27
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,534
是时候自己尝试一下了
Time to try for herself.

28
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,435
她需要找到更好的工具
She needs to find a better tool.

29
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,792
小石块的撞击力明显不够强
Small rocks just don't have the clout.

30
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,716
而大的则过于笨重
And larger ones are too cumbersome.

31
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,392
木头貌似既轻又结实
Wood is both light and strong...

32
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,065
但力度又不够
...but not strong enough.

33
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,489
回来再看看老师吧
Back to teacher.

34
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,831
年轻的黑猩猩可能要花十年
It may take a young chimp up to a decade to perfect

35
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,209
才能完美破解坚果所需的技能
the skills it needs for nut-cracking.

36
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,465
但是她已经掌握了一件本领
But she's already mastered one thing.

37
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,473
当她的手指无法触及里面的果仁时
When her fingers can't reach the nut inside...

38
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,603
她会折下树枝，适当调整
...she strips down a branch to size...

39
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,612
宛若汤匙
...and makes herself a spoon.

40
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:56,334
一生中将学习使用许多工具
She'll learn to use many tools in her life...

41
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,130
最终，她将分享这些知识
...and eventually she'll share this knowledge

42
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,967
给自己的幼崽
with youngsters of her own,

43
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:10,056
使后代能够收获雨林家园的食物资源
enabling them to harvest the riches of their rainforest home.

44
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:18,815
雨林中生活的丰富多样
The sheer abundance of life in the rainforests

45
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,486
非洲大陆东部的生存方式毫不逊色
is rivalled by that on the eastern side of the continent.

46
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:33,788
东非大裂谷纵观南北，全长6500公里
The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles down the length of Africa.

47
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,209
形成于大约在三千万年前
It developed some 30 million years ago,

48
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:43,131
地壳板块运动，当时一股巨大的熔岩
when a giant plume of molten rock pushing up from the depths

49
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,425
从深处推裂开了地壳
cracked the Earth's crust apart.

50
00:07:56,561 --> 00:08:00,398
淡水逐渐聚集在这个裂口的地板上
Fresh water began to accumulate on the floor of this rift...

51
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,902
形成了一系列湖泊
...and a chain of lakes developed.

52
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:11,450
这些湖泊现在是最丰富的淡水栖息地之一
These lakes are now one of the richest freshwater habitats

53
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,119
随处可见
to be found anywhere.

54
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,887
一个独特鱼类家族，慈鲷
One single family of fish here - the cichlids -

55
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:35,808
已经演变成1,500多种不同的品种
has evolved into more than 1,500 different species.

56
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,318
这看起来像天堂
This might look like paradise,

57
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:49,655
其实这些慈鲷物种之间的竞争非常激烈
but competition between these cichlid species is intense.

58
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,247
这个拥挤的世界危机四伏
This crowded world is a dangerous one.

59
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:04,170
毕竟，幼鱼可是不错的美味
Baby fish, after all, make a tasty meal.

60
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:12,261
因此，许多慈鲷妈妈已经进化出一套非常有效的育儿措施
So, many cichlid mothers have developed a very effective way

61
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,680
保护后代的安全
of keeping their offspring safe.

62
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,729
他们用嘴当流动托儿所
They use their mouths as a mobile nursery.

63
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,458
这是一个安全的避风港，鱼苗可以留在这里，直到危险过去
It's a safe haven where the fry can stay until danger has passed.

64
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,799
当危机解除，妈妈释放出它们
When the coast is clear, she releases them.

65
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,824
慈鲷雌性开始这种行为源于
This kind of behaviour starts when the cichlid female

66
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,870
她刚产下卵时 便将其放在嘴里以确保安全
picks up her newly laid eggs and holds them in her mouth to keep them safe.

67
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,969
在繁殖季节，雄性慈鲷闪烁着黄色的尾巴斑点
During spawning, her mate flashes his yellow tail spots

68
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,179
鼓励雌性持续产蛋
to encourage her to keep laying.

69
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,440
产出的卵
As each batch of eggs emerges,

70
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,109
慈鲷妈妈迅速含在口中
she scoops them up.

71
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,621
但是这对慈鲷的举动在被监视到了
But this couple are being watched...

72
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,087
这就是密点歧须鮠
...by cuckoo catfish.

73
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,112
密点歧须鮠成群结队地扫荡
They work as a gang

74
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:40,159
肆意吞食能发现的慈鲷卵
and devour as many cichlid eggs as they can find.

75
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,002
在一批嘈杂和混乱中
Then, in the middle of all this activity,

76
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:54,006
其中一只密点歧须鮠也开始产卵
one of the catfish also spawns.

77
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,806
慈鲷妈妈匆忙收集所有她能看见的卵
The cichlid mother collects every egg she can see.

78
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,276
现在，她要慢慢等待
Now, by herself, she must wait

79
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,113
嘴里的卵发育成熟
while the eggs in her mouth develop.

80
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,453
这需要三个星期
It will take three weeks.

81
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:31,419
这期间她一直没有吃东西
She doesn't eat throughout that entire time.

82
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,933
但是18天后
But 18 days later,

83
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,478
情况好像不太对劲
something is not right.

84
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,663
慈鲷妈妈竟然把没有发育好的卵吐了出来
The female blows out her young before they're fully ready to emerge.

85
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:16,589
然后是密点歧须鮠的幼鱼...
And they are followed by young cuckoo catfish...

86
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,602
个头是慈鲷婴儿的三倍
...three times the size of her own babies.

87
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,690
她的嘴里可能有多达六条密点歧须鮠
She may have as many as six of them in her mouth.

88
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,072
现在
And now

89
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,326
他们开始抢食慈鲷宝宝
they begin to eat the cichlid babies.

90
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:55,377
慈鲷妈妈把密点歧须鮠当成了自己亲生的孩子
The female cichlid treats the baby catfish as if they were hers.

91
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:03,427
它们是鱼类中的“杜鹃”
They are truly cuckoos among fish!

92
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,358
曾经鬼斧神工创造大裂谷的自然力量
The forces that created the Great Rift Valley

93
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,444
至今仍在塑造非洲的地貌
continue to shape Africa's landscape

94
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,530
即使在今天
even today.

95
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:32,456
在地壳的薄弱部位，熔融岩石继续喷发
At weak spots in the Earth's crust, molten rock continues to erupt.

96
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,091
非洲大陆上有200座火山...
There are some 200 volcanoes on the continent...

97
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,932
...其中许多活跃
...many of them active.

98
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,069
他们可能带来破坏
They may bring destruction

99
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:06,615
最终会成为生息之地
but also, eventually, fertility.

100
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:18,210
这是 伦盖伊火山
This is Ol Doinyo Lengai.

101
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:26,385
在过去的40万年中，喷发的火山灰
For the past 400,000 years, ash from this great volcano

102
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,764
撒落在塞伦盖蒂的热带稀树草原上
has fallen on the surrounding savannas of the Serengeti

103
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,058
并大大丰富了沃土
and greatly enriched them.

104
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,610
这是非洲大陆上最好的牧场
This is the best grazing on the continent.

105
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:55,956
这是世界上最大的迁徙动物群体
On it live the world's largest herds of migrating animals...

106
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:03,297
反过来 这个群体供养着各种捕食者
...and they, in turn, support predators.

107
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:25,361
在肯尼亚，猎豹已经形成了不同寻常的联盟
Here, in Kenya, cheetahs have formed an unusual alliance.

108
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:37,831
这些最快的猫科动物，通常两三只结伴捕猎
These swiftest of cats usually hunt in groups of two or three.

109
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:43,837
但是这是五搭档，是有记录以来最大的猎豹群体
But this team of five is one of the largest ever recorded.

110
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,021
其中包括两对兄弟
Two sets of brothers

111
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,232
还有一只雄性首领
and a lead male.

112
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:11,573
它们已经在一起生活和狩猎了将近三年
They have now lived and hunted together for almost three years.

113
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,217
通过合作，他们可以保持
By teaming up, they can hold

114
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,345
占据该地区最好的领土
the best territory in the area.

115
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:41,979
但即使这样，要供养五口成员，每次狩猎都至关重要
But, even so, with five mouths to feed, every hunt is very important.

116
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,449
他们已经三天没吃到食物
They haven't eaten for three days.

117
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:03,834
为了获取猎物，他们必须距离围捕场30米以内
To make a kill, they must get within 30 metres of their quarry

118
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,462
没有被发现
without being detected.

119
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,347
灌木丛遮蔽
Thick cover.

120
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,267
会帮助他们
That will help them.

121
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,996
转角牛羚几乎是猎豹的三倍
Topi - nearly three times their size...

122
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,797
牛羚身体强壮足够击退狮子
...and quite strong enough to fight off a lion,

123
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,049
更不用说一个猎豹了
let alone a single cheetah.

124
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,604
正在开阔地带
Now out in the open...

125
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:10,651
猎豹走的每一步都增加了他们成功的机会
...every step the cheetahs take increases their chance of success.

126
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:41,139
牛群四散而逃，猎豹分头追击
The herd scatter, and the team splits up.

127
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,060
但是他们距离目标还是不够近
But they didn't get close enough.

128
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,608
他们将目标切换到斑马
They switch targets to zebra.

129
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,226
现在草原上已经都知道猎豹在这里了
Everyone now knows that they're here.

130
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,447
他们必须调整捕猎战术
They must devise a different approach.

131
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,794
所有的目光都提防着猎豹兄弟
All eyes are on the brothers.

132
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:08,393
开阔地带，它们似乎没有威胁
Out in the open, they seem to be no threat.

133
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,399
雄性首领也不见踪影
But the lead male is missing.

134
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,794
猎豹兄弟负责迷惑敌人
The brothers are decoys.

135
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,602
陷阱已设置
The trap is set.

136
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,257
现在，其他四个人加入队伍
The other four now join the lead male.

137
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,473
在五头猎豹的联合攻击下
Under the combined weight of five cheetah,

138
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,476
猎物很快丧命
death comes quickly.

139
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,996
非洲的稀树草原供养着大型食草群体
Today, Africa's savannas support larger herds of big game

140
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,999
比世界上任何其他地方都多
than anywhere else in the world.

141
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,837
他们以不同的方式
And they, one way or another,

142
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,549
为各种小型动物提供食物
provide food for all kinds of smaller creatures.

143
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,263
一只牛椋鸟
An oxpecker.

144
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,730
一只足智多谋的小鸟，拥有独特的进食习性
A resourceful little bird with an unusual diet.

145
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:19,042
对他们来说，跳蚤和蜱虫等寄生虫
Fleas, ticks and even dandruff are food,

146
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,837
甚至皮屑都是美味
as far as they are concerned.

147
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,274
双方受益
Both parties benefit.

148
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,446
牛椋鸟能够饱餐一顿
The oxpecker gets a good meal...

149
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:53,994
那些自己无法够到的地方 得到了清理
...and the host is cleaned in those places it could never reach for itself.

150
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:14,389
一只牛椋鸟每天吃掉数百只蜱虫
Each bird, every day, collects hundreds of ticks

151
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,975
和成千上万的昆虫幼虫
and thousands of insect larvae.

152
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,940
甚至有些牛椋鸟会更加冒险
But some oxpeckers go for rather riskier meals.

153
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:40,707
河马具有很强的领土意识，而且残暴
Hippopotamus are highly territorial and very aggressive...

154
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:48,256
牛椋鸟必须时刻保持警惕
...so oxpeckers tackling them must always be on their guard.

155
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,848
但它的收获不止于此
But there's much to be gained.

156
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:11,446
血液是最有营养的食物
Blood is the most nutritious meal of all.

157
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,953
它们不停啄食避免伤口愈合，让血液不断流出
Pecking ensures that cuts remain open and blood keeps flowing.

158
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,752
牛椋鸟一旦发现伤口，便会紧跟不舍
And an oxpecker, once it's found an open wound,

159
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:30,507
根本不管寄主有多恼火
will stay alongside it, no matter how much that irritates its host.

160
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:52,237
好处是什么呢
The reward? An endless supply of food,

161
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,698
不管条件如何，都有血液供应
whatever the conditions.

162
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,875
并非整个非洲处处都富饶
Not all of Africa is rich and fertile.

163
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,427
这片大陆的三分之一是沙漠
A third of the continent is desert.

164
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,361
这是西南的纳米布沙漠
This is the Namib in the southwest.

165
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,996
在沙漠的中心，有一处70年前就废弃的
At its heart, a disused diamond mine

166
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:46,416
钻石矿
that was abandoned nearly 70 years ago.

167
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:57,761
但是这里还生活着一个居民
But it still has one inhabitant.

168
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,188
一位沙漠专家
A desert specialist...

169
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,904
也是非洲最罕见的掠食者之一
...and one of Africa's rarest predators.

170
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,913
棕色的鬣狗
The brown hyena.

171
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,260
这个鬼城是她的家
This ghost town is her home.

172
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:54,776
废墟保护她免受风吹日晒
Its ruins give her valuable protection from the elements.

173
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,579
她来这里已经15年了
She has been here for 15 years.

174
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,806
她已经饲养了九代幼崽
She's already reared nine generations of cubs.

175
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,793
这两个幼年鬣狗已经步入生命中的关键阶段
These two youngsters have reached a critical stage in their lives.

176
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:07,765
只有四个月大，需要不断获得固体食物
They're four months old, and now they need regular solid food.

177
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,062
但这些废墟中，没有可食用的东西，
But there is nothing edible in these ruins,

178
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,023
棕鬣狗妈妈要去别的地方觅食
so their mother has to look elsewhere

179
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:19,110
而且可能一去就是数几天
and may leave them for several days on end.

180
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:34,918
棕色鬣狗每天可能会走30多公里以寻找食物
Brown hyenas may walk over 20 miles a day in search of food.

181
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:49,349
这里称得上是我们星球上最为恶劣的环境之一
This is some of the most hostile country on the planet.

182
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:25,510
温度高达50摄氏度
Temperatures reach a blistering 50 degrees Celsius.

183
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,694
强风不断吹来
Strong winds blow incessantly.

184
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:58,084
纳米布的鬣狗从四面八方前往沙丘与大海的交汇处
Hyenas from all over the Namib head for where the sand dunes meet the sea.

185
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,471
绵延的沙滩
Somewhere along

186
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,849
这看似贫瘠荒凉
this seemingly barren stretch of sand,

187
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:18,021
但有的地方，存在大量食物
there is food in great quantity.

188
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,369
南非海狗
Cape fur seals.

189
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,584
这里大约有一万只
There are around 10,000 of them here.

190
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,727
成年南非海狗大而结实
Adult seals are large and strong.

191
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,320
但是他们的小崽都是幼小无力
But their pups are neither.

192
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,953
南非海狗妈妈们严密监护着
The youngsters are closely guarded by their mothers.

193
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:22,460
而棕鬣狗知道这需要耐心
A hyena, however, knows to be patient.

194
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,428
南非海豹妈妈们必须回到海中降温
Sooner or later, seal mothers must return to the ocean to cool off.

195
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:47,235
一只海狗幼崽可以喂鬣狗和她的家人几天
A single seal pup could feed a hyena and her family for days.

196
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,326
但是找到食物只是成功的一半
But finding food is only half the battle.

197
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,792
现在必须将食物安全带回
It now has to be carried back.

198
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:10,258
胡狼早已闻风而至
A jackal is here too...

199
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,098
而且也不是孤身一只
...and it's not alone.

200
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,610
如果棕鬣狗失去食物，她将不能养育幼崽
If a hyena loses her kill, she'll have nothing with which to feed her cubs.

201
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,337
胡狼在海岸活动，不会纠缠很远
The jackals won't follow her very far from the coast.

202
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:53,426
沙漠内部，对他们来说太热了
It's too hot for them in the desert interior.

203
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:01,517
经过这些漫长的旅程
Only by making these long journeys

204
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:06,898
棕鬣狗能在纳米布的中间生存吗？
can brown hyenas manage to survive in the middle of the Namib.

205
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,572
但是有些沙漠动物很少出远门
But some desert animals seldom move far.

206
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,578
卡拉哈里沙漠
The Kalahari Desert.

207
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,709
这里的食物非常充足
Here, food is more plentiful...

208
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,671
但是都是隐藏的很深
...but it's hidden.

209
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,891
穿山甲
A pangolin.

210
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:53,319
她可以捕获其他动物无法获得的食物
She can collect food that others can't reach.

211
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,659
敏锐的嗅觉使她能够发现沙子下面的蚁巢
A keen sense of smell enables her to detect

212
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:05,414
挖掘蚂蚁和白蚁
the presence of ants and termites in their nests beneath the sand.

213
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,354
它的舌头很粘，长约30厘米，
Her sticky tongue, some 30cm long,

214
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:32,525
能够从地下深处舔食到蚂蚁
enables her to collect them from deep underground.

215
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,327
它的举动在密切监控之下
And she's being carefully watched.

216
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:54,171
天气越干燥，白蚁的巢穴就越深
The drier it gets, the deeper the termites live.

217
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:59,844
许多甚至是穿山甲所不能及的
Many are way beyond the reach of even a pangolin.

218
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,765
但是这难不倒土豚
But not of an aardvark.

219
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:13,608
土豚是世界上最大的穴居动物
It's the world's largest burrowing animal.

220
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:23,910
它的嗅觉极为敏锐
Its sense of smell is extremely acute.

221
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,430
铲状的爪子和有力的腿使其能够向下挖掘
Shovel-like claws and powerful legs enable it to dig down

222
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,433
达到五到六米的深度
to depths of five or six metres.

223
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:58,152
一个成年的土豚每天需要吃掉约五万只白蚁
A full-grown aardvark needs to eat about 50,000 termites every day.

224
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,826
白蚁营养丰富，水分充沛，
Termites are highly nutritious and full of moisture,

225
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:09,830
可以在这里全年都可以找到
and they can be collected here year round.

226
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:25,763
土豚通常是夜间活动
Aardvark are usually nocturnal.

227
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,394
但这只土豚是在白天觅食
But the fact that this one is foraging in daylight

228
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,106
说明当地食物十分匮乏
is a sign that food is scarce.

229
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:44,073
卡拉哈里最近的干旱导致白蚁数量减少
Recent droughts in the Kalahari have led to low termite numbers

230
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:49,412
结果，这里的土豚深受其害 濒临饿死
and, as a consequence, aardvarks here are close to starvation.

231
00:38:55,292 --> 00:39:00,965
全球气候变化，正在影响非洲的许多动物的命运
Changes in the world's climate are affecting many of Africa's animals.

232
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,144
根据预测 到下个世纪
It's predicted that in the next century,

233
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:18,024
南非的气温升高将是全球平均升幅的两倍
Southern Africa will warm twice as much as the global average.

234
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:28,826
对于那些无法快速适应者而言，未来将是希望渺茫
The future will be bleak for those that cannot adapt fast enough.

235
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:41,088
津巴布韦已经六个月没有下雨了
In Zimbabwe, it hasn't rained in six months.

236
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,310
干旱期间，食物变得越来越难找
During a drought, food becomes harder and harder to find.

237
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:21,045
微白相思树的荚果中富含蛋白质
Apple-ring acacias produce pods that are full of protein...

238
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,800
但大都挂在高高的枝头
...but mostly on their higher branches.

239
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,848
荚果距离地面大约六米
Six metres up, they're out of reach,

240
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:37,728
即使是非洲大陆上最大的动物也够不到
even for the continent's largest animals.

241
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:23,941
这头公象每天需要吃掉约90公斤的植物
This bull elephant needs to eat about 90kg of vegetation every day.

242
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:44,545
他发展出了一套独特的生存方法
He's worked out a remarkable way of surviving

243
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,298
用来度过食物匮乏时期
in these lean times.

244
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:53,012
但这需要消耗巨大的体力
But it requires great physical strength.

245
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,160
能掌握这项技能的公象也是寥寥无几
Only a handful of bulls have mastered the skill.

246
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,395
重达五吨多
He weighs over five tonnes.

247
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,857
这是一项非凡的尝试
This is a truly monumental effort.

248
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:29,733
他周围的动物也是受益匪浅
Those around him benefit too.

249
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,460
大象利用自己的才智帮助它们生存
Elephants have used their great intelligence to help them survive

250
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,839
度过非洲几千年来最干旱的时期
Africa's driest times for millennia.

251
00:43:56,802 --> 00:44:00,848
但是今天，他们面临着更大的威胁
But today, they face an even greater threat.

252
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:13,319
据认为，曾经有多达两千万头大象生活在非洲
It's thought that as many as 20 million elephants once roamed the continent,

253
00:44:13,444 --> 00:44:17,614
后来许多是因为象牙而被杀害
but many have been killed for their tusks...

254
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:25,122
而象牙仅仅用于装饰为目的
...their ivory used for entirely ornamental purposes.

255
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:35,632
如今非洲仅存35万头大象
Now just 350,000 elephants remain.

256
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,602
这些被没收牙库，让人触目惊心
These stockpiles of confiscated tusks

257
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:51,357
这些仅是在短短一年内
represent half of the elephants killed on the continent

258
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:53,776
非洲大陆遇害大象数量的一半
in just one year.

259
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,124
但是在非洲所现存的的野生动物中
But of all of Africa's remaining wildlife,

260
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:13,629
受到盗猎影响最大的是犀牛
it is the rhinoceros that has been most affected by poaching.

261
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:24,181
在远东地区，犀牛角被用作传统药物
In the Far East, its horn is used as traditional medicine.

262
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:33,524
非洲所有的犀牛现在都受到威胁
All of Africa's rhinos are now under threat...

263
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:41,532
但是对于其中一个犀牛亚种来说，可能已经为时已晚
...but for one subspecies, it's likely to be already too late.

264
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,956
北白犀牛正面临灭绝
The northern white rhinoceros is facing extinction.

265
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,710
科学家们正在研究解决方案，
Scientists are working on a solution,

266
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:59,091
但是现在已经没有雄性的北白犀牛，自然繁殖是不可能的
but no male now survives, so natural breeding is impossible.

267
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,933
这两头是仅存的北白犀
These two females are the last of their kind.

268
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:11,145
当他们死后
When they die,

269
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:17,776
在地球上曾经生存数百万年的北白犀牛亚种
an entire subspecies that inhabited the Earth for millions of years

270
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,863
将永远消失
will have disappeared for ever.

271
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,995
在整个非洲大地
Right across Africa,

272
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,709
人类活动对所有野生动植物造成毁灭性影响
human beings are having a devastating impact on all wildlife.

273
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,214
猎豹数量每年都在减少
Cheetah numbers are decreasing

274
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,841
year on year.

275
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:48,182
如今，非洲大陆上还剩下不到八千只猎豹
Today, there are fewer than 8,000 left on the continent.

276
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:05,324
人们将穿山甲鳞片用于传统医学的需求
The global demand for pangolin scales for use in traditional medicine

277
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:09,953
现在使它们成为地球上非法走私最多的动物
has now made them the most trafficked animal on the planet.

278
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:19,087
西非黑猩猩受到栖息地丧失的威胁
And western chimpanzees are so threatened by the loss of their habitat

279
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:22,424
他们现在的处境岌岌可危，已经被列入极度濒危
that they are now critically endangered.

280
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,430
在这只雌性的生命历程中
In this female's lifetime,

281
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:31,600
科特迪瓦有四分之三的森林遭到砍伐
three-quarters of the forest in the Ivory Coast

282
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,186
用于种植农作物
has been felled for plantations.

283
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,320
砍伐森林并不是非洲的特有现象
Deforestation - and not only in Africa -

284
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:46,657
目前仍在大规模持续发生
continues on an enormous scale.

285
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:56,583
如今 每年毁坏2600完公顷的森林
64 million acres of forest are destroyed every year

286
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,379
用于发展农业和工业
to make way for agriculture and industry.

287
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,634
这意味着，每秒钟就有相当于
