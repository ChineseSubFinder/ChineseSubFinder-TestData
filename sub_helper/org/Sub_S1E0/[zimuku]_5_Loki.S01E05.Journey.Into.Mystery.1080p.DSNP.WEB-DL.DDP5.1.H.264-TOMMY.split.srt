1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,740
{\an9}-相信这个人可不明智 我能搞定他

2
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,740
-Trusting this man is not a good idea. I can handle him.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,990
{\an9}时间变异管理局已经裁剪过这家伙很多次了 他们各不相同

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,990
The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys, and no two are alike.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,156
{\an9}你们都是时间犯

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,156
LOKI: You're all Variants!

7
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,541
{\an9}时间守护者并没有创造你们 他们把你们从时间线上绑架了

8
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,541
The Time-Keepers didn't create you. They kidnapped you from the timeline.

9
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,583
{\an9}前情提要

10
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,448
{\an9}你们两个造成的关连事件

11
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,448
MOBIUS: The nexus event you caused,

12
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,406
{\an9}不管是什么关系 会让这个地方崩溃

13
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,406
whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.

14
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,656
{\an9}好吧 你想知道真相吗？

15
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,656
RENSLAYER: Fine. You want the truth?

16
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,156
{\an9}我在试着保护你

17
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,156
I'm trying to protect you.

18
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,656
{\an9}像我们这样的友谊并不常见

19
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,656
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

20
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,656
{\an9}你知道让我选 我想去哪里吗？

21
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,656
You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere?

22
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,698
{\an9}从哪里来我就该回哪里去

23
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,698
Wherever it is I'm really from.

24
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,031
{\an9}对 在时间变异管理局之前我生活的地方

25
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,031
Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.

26
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,125
{\an9}裁剪掉他

27
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,125
-Prune him.

28
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,865
{\an9}时间守护者夺走了你们的人生

29
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,865
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

30
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,615
{\an9}你们都是时间犯

31
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,615
You're Variants.

32
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,625
{\an9}咱们是一样的

33
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,625
We're the same.

34
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,698
{\an9}没有灵魂的机器人

35
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,698
SYLVIE: Mindless androids.

36
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,448
{\an9}那是谁创造了时间变异管理局？

37
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,448
LOKI: Then who created the TVA?

38
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,958
{\an9}希尔维 我有话要对你说

39
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,958
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

40
00:00:55,833 --> 00:01:00,250
{\an9}把你知道的一切都告诉我

41
00:00:55,833 --> 00:01:00,250
You're gonna tell me everything.

42
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:42,500
{\an9}漫威影业

43
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,323
{\an9}这是什么地方？我们在哪？你们是谁？

44
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,323
LOKI: What is this place? Where are we? Who are you?

45
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,416
{\an9}这里是虚空 那是艾利奥斯 而我们是它的午餐 赶紧吧

46
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,416
This is The Void. That's Alioth. And we're his lunch. Come on!

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,666
{\an9}洛基

48
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,958
{\an9}把你的时间控制器给我

49
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,958
Give me your TemPad.

50
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,990
{\an9}-时间变异管理局背后是谁在操控？ 我也不知道

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,990
-Who's really behind the TVA? I'm as in the dark as you are.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,365
{\an9}可悲的洛斯蕾尔法官 你所认定的现实都被颠覆了

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,365
Poor Judge Renslayer. Your whole reality's been destroyed.

54
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:10,833
{\an9}跟我说说 知道真相的感觉如何？

55
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:10,833
Tell me, how does it feel to be on the other side of it?

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,875
{\an9}也就这样了 是不是？

57
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,875
This is it, isn't it?

58
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,291
{\an9}这就是你在窃取我人生后 带我来的地方

59
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,291
This is where you dragged me after you stole my life.

60
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:26,541
{\an9}-也会是你人生被夺走最合适的地方 要是我说洛基还没死呢？

61
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:26,541
-A fitting place, then, to take yours. And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?

62
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,698
{\an9}至少应该还没有

63
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,698
Not yet, anyway.

64
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,240
{\an9}-你在说谎 也许吧

65
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,240
-I'd say you were lying. Maybe.

66
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,740
{\an9}-也许咱们想要的东西是一样的 他怎么可能还活着？

67
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,740
-Or maybe we want the same thing. How is he still alive?

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,323
{\an9}以及我们能通过救他来接近 时间变异管理局背后的主使吗？

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,323
And how will saving him get us closer to who's really behind the TVA?

70
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,156
{\an9}这事比较复杂

71
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,156
It's complicated.

72
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,448
{\an9}-告诉你这些我心甘情愿 为什么？

73
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,448
-I'm telling you this willingly. Why?

74
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,448
{\an9}因为我想知道谁在掌控这一切

75
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,448
Because I wanna know who's at the top of this.

76
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,625
{\an9}我想知道谁欺骗了我

77
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,625
I want to know who lied to me.

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,198
{\an9}当我们裁剪一个分支现实的时候

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,198
When we prune a branched reality,

80
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,656
{\an9}我们不可能毁灭掉所有的一切

81
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,656
it's impossible to destroy all of its matter.

82
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:58,031
{\an9}所以我们把它移动到时间线上的某个地方 让它停止发展

83
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:58,031
So we move it to a place on the timeline where it won't continue growing.

84
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,740
{\an9}基本上来说 时间线分支并没有重置

85
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,740
Basically, the branched timeline isn't reset.

86
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,823
{\an9}-而是被转移了 转移去了哪里？

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,823
-It's transferred. To where?

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,198
{\an9}时间尽头的虚空

89
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,198
A void at the end of time.

90
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,823
{\an9}在那里 所有的存在互相碰撞

91
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,823
Where every instance of existence collides at the same point

92
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,740
{\an9}然后停止发展

93
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,740
and simply stops.

94
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
{\an9}为什么？

95
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
Why?

96
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,031
{\an9}我也不知道

97
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,031
I don't know.

98
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,823
{\an9}规则里面说 时间的尽头仍然在书写中

99
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,823
The dogma states that the end of time is still being written,

100
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,906
{\an9}时间守护者会把它变成乌托邦

101
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,906
that the Time-Keepers are transforming it into utopia.

102
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,615
{\an9}说得好听 真是唬人啊

103
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,615
That's nice. Super believable.

104
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,083
{\an9}不管真实原因是什么…

105
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,083
Whatever the real reason. . .

106
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,833
{\an9}从来没有什么能从那里回来

107
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,833
nothing ever comes back from there.

108
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,333
{\an9}如果你相信我 我能帮你

109
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,333
I can help you if you trust me.

110
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,823
{\an9}我建议咱们歇一下 我有无数个问题想问

111
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,823
I suggest we take a breather, so I can ask several thousand questions.

112
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,823
{\an9}-不想死就赶紧走 好吧 但是你的计划是什么？

113
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,823
-Gotta keep moving so we don't die. Okay, but what's your plan?

114
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,615
{\an9}-别死 好吧 还有呢？

115
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,615
-Don't die. Okay, but beyond that?

116
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,323
{\an9}-别死 这算不上计划

117
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,323
-Don't die. That's not a plan.

118
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:13,250
{\an9}这只是求生欲 作为洛基 就应该永远有计划…

119
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:13,250
It's a general demand of living. If you're Lokis, you should always have. . .

120
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,791
{\an9}有没有谁能给我解释一下 到底是怎么回事？

121
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,791
Will someone please explain to me what the hell is going on?

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,948
{\an9}过去的几天里 我一直非常非常地努力

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,948
Look, it's been a very, very, very trying past few days.

124
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,823
{\an9}或许是几个月？我都不知道 自从纽约事件后到底过了多久

125
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,823
Months? I don't even know how long it's been since New York.

126
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,073
{\an9}我只知道我被裁剪了 醒来就在这里了

127
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,073
All I know is, I got pruned and I woke up here,

128
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,573
{\an9}还有一群跟我身份一样的时间犯围着我 以及一只短吻鳄

129
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,573
and now I'm surrounded by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,

130
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,365
{\an9}可悲的是我都不觉得奇怪

131
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,365
which sadly I didn't find all that strange.

132
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,115
{\an9}现在我们既不知道在逃避什么鬼 也不知道该往什么鬼地方逃

133
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,115
And now we're running from God knows what to God knows where.

134
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,375
{\an9}而我需要想办法回到时间变异管理局去

135
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,375
When I need to be trying to find a way back to the TVA.

136
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,708
{\an9}别叫唤了 你会引来艾里奥斯的

137
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,708
Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

138
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,958
{\an9}你说那个天上的怪物？

139
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,958
You mean the monster in the sky?

140
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,781
{\an9}谢谢

141
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,781
Thank you.

142
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,948
{\an9}这里是时间变异管理局的垃圾场

143
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,948
This is the place where the TVA dumps its rubbish,

144
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,031
{\an9}所有被裁剪的东西都在这里

145
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,031
everything they prune.

146
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,333
{\an9}然后艾里奥斯

147
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,333
And Alioth,

148
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,240
{\an9}确保这些东西有来无回

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,240
he ensures none of it ever returns.

150
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,240
{\an9}它是个有生命的风暴 吞噬物质和能量

151
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,240
BOASTFUL LOKI: It's a living tempest that consumes matter and energy.

152
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,948
{\an9}他们把所有分支现实扔到这 然后被立刻吞噬…

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,948
They send entire branched realities here that are devoured instant--

154
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,833
{\an9}我们就像在鲨鱼缸里 艾里奥斯就是鲨鱼

155
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,833
We're in a shark tank. Alioth is the shark.

156
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,656
{\an9}并没有什么鳄鱼缸

157
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,656
Oh, there's no such thing as an alligator tank.

158
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,990
{\an9}而且这就是个比喻而已 他跟我们其他人一样 太敏感了

159
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,990
Besides, it's a better metaphor. He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,198
{\an9}等等

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,198
Hang on,

162
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,541
{\an9}-那玩意也是洛基？ 是啊

163
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,541
-that thing's a Loki too? Oh, yes.

164
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,823
{\an9}好吧 没什么不能接受的 为什么有这么多个你们？

165
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,823
Okay, fine. Willing to accept that. Why are there so many of you?

166
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,948
{\an9}因为洛基总能活下来 这可是咱们的强项

167
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,948
Because Lokis survive. That's just what we do.

168
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,823
{\an9}-太棒了 那咱们怎么逃出去？ 我们逃不出去

169
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,823
-Great. So how do we escape? We don't.

170
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,656
{\an9}我们都是被时间变异管理局逮捕 然后裁剪掉的 和你一样

171
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,656
All of us were arrested by the TVA and pruned, just like you.

172
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,323
{\an9}而且我们都在制定各种无谓的计划 也和你一样

173
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,323
And just like you, we all stood around making bad plans that went nowhere.

174
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,740
{\an9}咱们可以使用时间控制器啊

175
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,740
But we could use a TemPad.

176
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,240
{\an9}逃跑的救命稻草 没错

177
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh, the one thing that could get us out of here, yes.

178
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,375
{\an9}应该到处都有吧 是不是？

179
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,375
They're all over the place, right, guys?

180
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,406
{\an9}好吧 那如果制造出一个关连事件呢？

181
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,406
Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

182
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,615
{\an9}时间变异管理局根本不在乎这里发生了什么

183
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,615
The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

184
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,448
{\an9}-总能做点什么吧 有

185
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,448
-Surely there's something to do. There is.

186
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,031
{\an9}活下去 这是唯一的办法 从过去到现在都一样

187
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,031
Survive. That's all there is. All there ever was.

188
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,781
{\an9}话说完了 咱们走吧

189
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,781
KID LOKI: We're done talking. Let's go.

190
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,083
{\an9}你想怎样随便吧

191
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,083
Just do what you want.

192
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,625
{\an9}好吧 等等 等等

193
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,625
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,948
{\an9}你为什么戴着角？你对那个小孩言听计从

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,948
Why do you wear the horns? You let a child command you.

196
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,958
{\an9}你可得尊重那个孩子

197
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,958
You'll do well to respect the boy.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,490
{\an9}-这是他的王国 对

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,490
-This is his kingdom. LOKI: Right.

200
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,490
{\an9}你的关连事件是什么 国王陛下？

201
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,490
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

202
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,708
{\an9}我杀了索尔

203
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,708
I killed Thor.

204
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,791
{\an9}话说回来 你为什么这么急着 回时间变异管理局？

205
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,791
So, why did you want to return to the TVA so badly, anyway?

206
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,333
{\an9}你把光荣的使命留在那里了？

207
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,333
You leave your glorious purpose there?

208
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
{\an9}差不多吧

209
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
Something like that.

210
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,031
{\an9}时间小姐 我需要远程接入

211
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,031
RENSLAYER: Miss Minutes, I need you to remote access

212
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,490
{\an9}存档中的一些机密文件

213
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,490
a series of restricted files from the archives.

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,573
{\an9}天啊 关于什么的？

215
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,573
MISS MINUTES: Ooh, doggy! On what?

216
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,240
{\an9}时间的起始 时间变异管理局的建立

217
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,240
RENSLAYER: The beginning of time. The founding of the TVA.

218
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,708
{\an9}-马上 等等

219
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,708
-MISS MINUTES: Right away. Wait.

220
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,531
{\an9}-看看时间的尽头怎么样？ 那就是虚空而已

221
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,531
-What about the end of time? It's just a void.

222
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,791
{\an9}如果虚空不是尽头呢？ 如果还有虚空以外的东西呢？

223
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,791
What if The Void isn't the end? What if there's something beyond it?

224
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,781
{\an9}我就是躲在末日的阴影下 才逃离了时间变异管理局的视线

225
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,781
Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses obscured me from the TVA

226
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,708
{\an9}因为我在那里不能创造分支 对不对？

227
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,708
because I couldn't create a diverging branch there, right?

228
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,406
{\an9}所以如果这些都仍然在书写中 发生的任何事都会是一条新的时间线

229
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,406
So if all of this is still being written, whatever happens is just a new timeline.

230
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,823
{\an9}在那里不可能出现关连事件

231
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,823
It would be impossible to start a nexus event there.

232
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,906
{\an9}-你可能完全无法被发现 就是这样

233
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,906
-You could be completely undetectable. That's it.

234
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,458
{\an9}-那是他们唯一能去的地方 那我们怎么穿越虚空呢？

235
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,458
-That's the only place they could be. So how do we get past The Void?

236
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,490
{\an9}这是不可能的

237
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,490
It's impossible.

238
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,656
{\an9}时间控制器无法定位 没有目的地

239
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,656
There's nothing for the TemPad to lock onto, no destination.

240
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
{\an9}那我们就穿过它看看

241
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
Then we go through it.

242
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,823
{\an9}-这是自杀 那我觉得留着你也没什么用了

243
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,823
-That's suicide. Then I guess my need for you has passed.

244
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,531
{\an9}等等 试试虚空飞船怎么样？

245
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,531
Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

246
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,656
{\an9}对 那个原型机

247
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,656
Yes, the prototype.

248
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,708
{\an9}太好了 我来找文件

249
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,708
Great. I'll get the file.

250
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,531
{\an9}那艘飞船是用来应对现世虚空的

251
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,531
It's a spaceship designed to withstand the temporal void.

252
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,656
{\an9}它能把我们带到时间的尽头

253
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,656
It could take us to the end of time.

254
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,823
{\an9}-找到洛基 找到幕后的主使

255
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,823
-Find Loki. Find the man behind the curtain.

256
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,416
{\an9}-然后杀了他 齐心协力

257
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,416
-And kill him. Together.

258
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,906
{\an9}时间小姐 这艘时间飞船的文件在哪里？

259
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,906
Miss Minutes, where are the files on this timecraft?

260
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,375
{\an9}正在搜索 亲爱的

261
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,375
MISS MINUTES: Still lookin', hon.

262
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,031
{\an9}还没找到吗？

263
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,031
Nothing?

264
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,031
{\an9}它埋藏得很深

265
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,031
Hmm. Buried pretty deep.

266
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,948
{\an9}那是高度机密 我可能都没有权限

267
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,948
It's highly restricted. I might not even have clearance.

268
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,083
{\an9}不 我觉得你有 如果它真实存在的话

269
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,083
Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

270
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,615
{\an9}还要多久？

271
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,615
How long?

272
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,031
{\an9}随时都有可能

273
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,031
Any second now.

274
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,500
{\an9}上啊 快点

275
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,500
GUARD: Go! Go! Go! Move it!

276
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,740
{\an9}-你受伤了吗？ 我没事 但是她拿了我的时间控制器

277
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,740
-You hurt? I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.

278
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,656
{\an9}希尔维？你不会还想逃跑吧？

279
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,656
Sylvie? Not thinking of going on the run, are you?

280
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,000
{\an9}我们知道你藏在哪

281
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,000
We know where you hide.

282
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,000
{\an9}我们早晚会抓住你

283
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,000
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.

284
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,000
{\an9}你肯定已经筋疲力尽了

285
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,000
It must be so exhausting.

286
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,208
{\an9}我承认刚才有那么一瞬间 我相信了你

287
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,208
I'll admit you had me fooled there for a minute.

288
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,865
{\an9}也有可能你说的是真心话

289
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,865
Or did you get a little real?

290
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,906
{\an9}洛斯蕾尔法官真的觉得 被她心爱的时间变异管理局背叛了吗？

291
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,906
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed by her beloved TVA?

292
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,990
{\an9}要不然你出来 咱们好好聊聊？

293
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,990
Why don't you come back out and we can talk about it?

294
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,781
{\an9}没问题 让其他人退下 咱们自己解决

295
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,781
Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off and we can settle this between us.

296
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,281
{\an9}我接受

297
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,281
Works for me.

298
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,531
{\an9}你不是还说要去抓幕后主使吗？

299
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,531
What happened to finding the man behind the curtain?

300
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,365
{\an9}我告诉你 举起双手出来

301
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,365
Tell you what. You come out with your hands up

302
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,073
{\an9}我就把你放到时间循环里

303
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,073
and I'll put you in a time loop.

304
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,490
{\an9}也让你少受点罪

305
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,490
Something not so bad.

306
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,750
{\an9}你可以不断重温那些美好的回忆

307
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,750
You can live out your days in a good memory.

308
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
{\an9}你有美好的回忆吗？

309
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
Do you have any good memories?

310
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,333
{\an9}其实只有一个

311
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,333
Just one, really.

312
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,541
{\an9}-她自我裁剪了 很好

313
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,541
-She self-pruned. Good.

314
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,166
{\an9}那她也就完蛋了

315
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,166
Then she's dead, too.

316
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,000
{\an9}洛克西酒 上等黑皮诺

317
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:03,198
{\an9}在我征服了美国队长和钢铁侠以后

318
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:03,198
So, after I vanquished Captain America and Iron Man,

319
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:08,041
{\an9}我拿到了我的奖赏 全部六颗无限原石

320
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:08,041
I claimed my prize, all six Infinity Stones.

321
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,031
{\an9}那只短吻鳄在咆哮着说 〝骗子〞

322
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,031
That's alligator for growling and saying "liar" at the same time.

323
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:18,458
{\an9}至少我的关连事件不是吃错了邻居的猫

324
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:18,458
At least my nexus event wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

325
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,156
{\an9}-讲讲你的故事 洛基 我的？

327
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,156
-Tell them your story, Loki. Me?

328
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,365
{\an9}不会有人想听的

329
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,365
Nobody wants to hear about that.

330
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,125
{\an9}其实我还挺想听的

331
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,125
I would, actually.

332
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:44,041
{\an9}我就一直在想 因为我…

333
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:44,041
Um. . . It's just I've been wondering, because I'm. . .

334
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,781
{\an9}我们本来该死掉的 是不是？

335
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,781
Well, we're supposed to die, right?

336
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,281
{\an9}灭霸在诸神的黄昏后杀了我们

337
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,281
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

338
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,333
{\an9}灭霸？

339
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,333
Thanos?

340
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,125
{\an9}在我的时间线里

341
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,125
In my timeline,

342
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,240
{\an9}一切都进行得很正常 我的一生都很正常

343
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,240
everything proceeded correctly, my entire life,

344
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,531
{\an9}直到灭霸袭击了我们的飞船

345
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,531
until Thanos attacked our ship.

346
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,281
{\an9}你没试着去刺杀他吗？

347
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,281
So, you didn't try to stab him?

348
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,823
{\an9}当然没有

349
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,823
Certainly not.

350
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,698
{\an9}我无意冒犯 朋友

351
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,698
Take no offense, my friends,

352
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,281
{\an9}但是在洛基的法术面前 兵刃一文不值

353
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,281
but blades are worthless in the face of a Loki sorcery.

354
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,948
{\an9}它们会阻碍我们的魔法潜力

355
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,948
They stunt our magical potential.

356
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,531
{\an9}-但是它们看上去很厉害 是的

357
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,531
-But they look awesome. CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yes.

358
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,865
{\an9}特别是当你被掐住脖子 它们掉在地上的时候

359
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,865
Especially when they clatter to the ground just before your neck is snapped.

360
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:28,365
{\an9}我制造了一个非常逼真的自己的投影 连灭霸都被骗过了

361
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:28,365
I cast a projection of myself so real, even the Mad Titan believed it.

362
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,198
{\an9}然后我在一堆尸体里装死

363
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,198
Then hid as inanimate debris.

364
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,208
{\an9}伪造了死亡以后 我就在宇宙中游荡

365
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,208
After I faked my death, I simply drifted in space.

366
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,115
{\an9}远离索尔 远离一切

367
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,115
Away from Thor, away from everything.

368
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,573
{\an9}我思考关于宇宙的一切 思考我应在的位置

369
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,573
Thought about the universe and my place in it,

370
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,365
{\an9}然后我突然明白了 我所到之处

371
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,365
and it occurred to me that everywhere I went,

372
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,406
{\an9}只会带去痛苦

373
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,406
only pain followed.

374
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,573
{\an9}所以我就把自己从等式里抹掉了

375
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,573
So I removed myself from the equation,

376
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:54,490
{\an9}我在一个偏远的星球落脚 独自一人 离群索居

377
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:54,490
landed on a remote planet and stayed there in isolation, in solitude

378
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,750
{\an9}这样过了很久很久

379
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,750
for a long, long time.

380
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,031
{\an9}时间变异管理局怎么找到你的？

381
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,031
How did the TVA find you?

382
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,041
{\an9}我有点寂寞了

383
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,041
I got lonely.

384
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,865
{\an9}说老实话 我想我哥哥了

385
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,865
To tell you the truth, I missed my brother,

386
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,698
{\an9}我在想 他会不会在思念我 有没有人会思念我

387
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,698
and I wondered if he missed me, if anybody else did.

388
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,906
{\an9}但就在我刚刚要离开那颗星球的时候

389
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,906
But as soon as I took my first steps to getting off the planet,

390
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,073
{\an9}时间变异管理局就来了

391
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,073
the TVA arrived.

392
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,573
{\an9}因为 亲爱的朋友 咱们只能扮演一个角色

393
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,573
Because we, my friends, have but one part to play,

394
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,208
{\an9}流放之神

395
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,208
the God of Outcasts.

396
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,041
{\an9}除此之外没有了

397
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,041
Nothing more.

398
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,750
{\an9}流放之神

399
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,750
The God of Outcasts.

400
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,490
{\an9}-我要走了 去哪？

401
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,490
-I'm going. Going where?

402
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,990
{\an9}从这里出去 从虚空出去 回到时间变异管理局去

403
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,990
Out of this place, out of The Void, back to the TVA.

404
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,281
{\an9}咱们既擅长生存 又擅长逃跑

405
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,281
We're as good at escaping as we are at surviving.

406
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,073
{\an9}所以咱们机会很大

407
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,073
That gives me a decent chance.

408
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,115
{\an9}-你哪个也干不好 你会被干掉的 那我也认了

409
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,115
-You won't do either, you'll be murdered. Well, so be it.

410
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,781
{\an9}-那就是我本来的宿命 你与众不同

411
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,781
-That was my destiny to begin with. You're different.

412
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,906
{\an9}-为什么？ 我没什么不一样的 你明白吗？

413
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,906
-Why? No, I'm not, you see?

414
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,740
{\an9}我和你们一样 真的 我和你们所有人都一样

415
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm the same, really. I'm the same as all of you.

416
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,656
{\an9}你们有谁遇到过女性的时间犯吗？

417
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,656
Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?

418
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,906
{\an9}-听上去很可怕 她确实挺可怕

419
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,906
-Sounds terrifying. Oh, she is.

420
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,115
{\an9}但这就是她吸引人的地方

421
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,115
But that's kind of what's great about her.

422
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,490
{\an9}她才是与众不同的

423
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,490
She's different.

424
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,948
{\an9}她不是企图接管时间变异管理局 而是要推翻它

425
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,948
She's not trying to take over the TVA, she's trying to take it down.

426
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,906
{\an9}她需要我

427
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,906
And she needs me.

428
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,250
{\an9}你说因为艾里奥斯 咱们只能困在这

429
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,250
Now, you said Alioth is what keeps us here.

430
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,281
{\an9}你说它是有生命的 你说它是条鲨鱼

431
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,281
You said it's a living thing. You said it's a shark.

432
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:30,031
{\an9}那么如果它有生命 它就会死亡

433
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:30,031
Well, if it lives, it dies.

434
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,698
{\an9}所以我要去杀了那条鲨鱼

435
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,698
So I'm gonna kill the shark.

436
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,500
{\an9}我要杀了艾里奥斯 我需要你们的帮助

437
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm gonna kill Alioth, and I could use all the help I can get.

438
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,333
{\an9}太棒了 宝贝 太搞笑了

439
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,333
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

440
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,333
{\an9}-一群怪物 太搞笑了

441
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,333
-Monsters. CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yeah.

442
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,708
{\an9}你好 你是我们中的哪一个？

443
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,708
Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?

444
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,708
{\an9}这简直是噩梦

445
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,708
This is a nightmare.

446
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,073
{\an9}是你

447
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,073
SYLVIE: You.

448
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,490
{\an9}把门关上 咱们还没脱险呢

449
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,490
Shut the door, we still got a situation here.

450
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,750
{\an9}就这么随便上陌生人的车 你可得小心点

451
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,750
You should be careful just jumping into a stranger's car like that.

452
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,573
{\an9}-当心 我看见了 我看见了

453
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,573
-Watch out! I see it, I see it.

454
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,406
{\an9}-真的吗？你直接就撞过去了 天啊 你真的和你们一模一样

455
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,406
-Really? You're driving right towards it. God, you really are one of you.

456
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,416
{\an9}等等

457
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,416
Hang on.

458
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,865
{\an9}洛基 竞选总统

459
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,531
{\an9}你这个混蛋 你这是引狼入室

460
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,531
You bastard! You led the wolves to our door.

461
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,906
{\an9}我们认为蛇比狼更贴切

462
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,906
We prefer snakes to wolves.

463
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,906
{\an9}这些我都干掉过 它们的死法没什么区别

464
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,906
I've eaten both. They die just the same.

465
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,781
{\an9}抱歉 我的陛下

466
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,781
Apologies, my liege.

467
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:23,375
{\an9}我背叛了你 现在我是国王了

468
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:23,375
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

469
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,740
{\an9}说到这件事吧…

470
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,740
About that. . .

471
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,656
{\an9}-你不是认真的吧 拜托

472
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,656
-You can't be serious. Come on.

473
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,031
{\an9}-你想要什么？ 我不是在讨价还价

474
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,031
-What did you expect? That was not the bargain!

475
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,406
{\an9}我给你提供了我们的位置 你得给我们庇护和供给

476
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,406
I gave you our location. In exchange for shelter and supplies,

477
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,740
{\an9}给我你的军队 我去夺取王位

478
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,740
you give me your army and I take the throne.

479
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,031
{\an9}好吧

480
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,031
PRESIDENT LOKI: Ah, yes.

481
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,281
{\an9}这交易不怎么样

482
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,281
Not so good a bargain.

483
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:44,115
{\an9}那这个怎么样？ 军队是我的 王位也是我的

484
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:44,115
How about this one? My army, my throne?

485
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,416
{\an9}说到这件事吧

486
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,416
About that.

487
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,781
{\an9}你们这些愚蠢的下贱东西 为什么要这么做？

488
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,781
Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.

489
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,833
{\an9}-咱们说好的 看在老天的份上

490
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,833
-We had a deal! For God's sake.

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,990
{\an9}这里为什么会有只短吻鳄？

492
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,990
Why the hell is there an alligator in here?

493
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,250
{\an9}他是个洛基

494
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,250
ALL: He's a Loki!

495
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,833
{\an9}为了光荣的使命

496
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,833
BOASTFUL LOKI: Glorious purpose!

497
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,166
{\an9}来这边

498
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,166
Come on.

499
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,583
{\an9}进来 洛基

500
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,583
Take that, Loki!

501
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,448
{\an9}该死 一群禽兽！

502
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,448
Damn it! Animals, animals!

503
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,823
{\an9}我们撒谎 我们欺骗

504
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,823
We lie and we cheat,

505
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,990
{\an9}我们杀害了每个相信我们的人 为的是什么？

506
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,990
we cut the throat of every person who trusts us, and for what?

507
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,291
{\an9}权力 光荣的权力 光荣的使命

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,291
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!

509
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,365
{\an9}我们不能改变

510
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,365
We cannot change.

511
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,823
{\an9}我们就是坏蛋 每个版本都是 永远如此

512
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,823
We're broken, every version of us. Forever.

513
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,573
{\an9}无论什么时候 如果有哪个 企图改邪归正

514
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,573
And whenever one of us dares try to fix themselves,

515
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,240
{\an9}他们就会被送到这来送死

516
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,240
they're sent here to die.

517
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,490
{\an9}这就是我为什么得从这出去

518
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,490
That's why I need to get out of here.

519
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,990
{\an9}除非时间变异管理局被干掉 否则什么也改变不了

520
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,990
Nothing can change until the TVA is stopped.

521
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,698
{\an9}-你相信她吗？ 她是我唯一相信的人

522
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,698
-And you trust her? She's the only one I do trust.

523
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,781
{\an9}而此时此刻 我认为她是我们 干掉时间变异管理局唯一的机会

524
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,781
And right now, I believe she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.

525
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,208
{\an9}这对我就够了

526
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,208
That's good enough for me.

527
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,041
{\an9}好吧 好吧 我们帮你

528
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,041
Okay, okay. We'll help you.

529
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,541
{\an9}但是接近艾里奥斯就是送死

530
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,541
But approaching Alioth is a death sentence.

531
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,958
{\an9}我们会帮你接近它 但是也就到此为止了

532
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,958
We'll get you to it, but that's as far as we go.

533
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,115
{\an9}一直以来 我真的认为我们都是好人

534
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,115
All that time, I really believed we were the good guys.

535
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,656
{\an9}消除所有的现实 让小女孩无父无母

536
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,656
Annihilating entire realities, orphaning little girls,

537
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,656
{\an9}真是经典的英雄事迹

538
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,656
classic hero stuff.

539
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,490
{\an9}我想 如果为了结果可以不择手段

540
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,490
Well, I guess when you think the ends justify the means,

541
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,115
{\an9}就没有什么是你不能做的了

542
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,115
there's not much you won't do.

543
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,656
{\an9}而且你也没少消除东西

544
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,656
By the way, you did some annihilating too.

545
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,656
{\an9}-我那是迫不得已 没错 我也是

546
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,656
-I did what I had to do. Yeah, so did I.

547
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,333
{\an9}你像只猎狗一样追杀我

548
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,333
You hunted me like a dog.

549
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,541
{\an9}我很抱歉

550
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,541
I'm sorry about that.

551
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,333
{\an9}当我裁剪自己的时候 我觉得也许能找到洛基

552
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,333
When I pruned myself, I thought I might be able to find Loki.

553
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,781
{\an9}那个风暴 那个东西 可能已经抓住他了

554
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,781
That storm, that thing, it's likely already got him.

555
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,281
{\an9}你真的这么认为吗？

556
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,281
You really believe that?

557
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
{\an9}这不重要

558
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
It doesn't matter.

559
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,323
{\an9}现在唯一重要的事就是从这出去

560
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,323
The only thing that matters now is getting out of here

561
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,490
{\an9}然后找到幕后的主使

562
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,490
and finding out who's behind all of this.

563
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,031
{\an9}好 我们该怎么做？

564
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,031
Great. How do we do that?

565
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,208
{\an9}我们需要掉头

566
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,208
We turn around.

567
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,823
{\an9}掉头？回去找那团愤怒的乌云？

568
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,823
Turn around? What, and go back to the angry cloud?

569
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,365
{\an9}对 我觉得那就是答案所在

570
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,365
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

571
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,750
{\an9}我们要回去找它

572
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,750
We're going back to it.

573
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:13,698
{\an9}我必须得说 和那团庞然大物面对面 感觉有点糟糕

574
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:13,698
CLASSIC LOKI: I have to say, it feels odd walking toward the gargantuan creature.

575
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,448
{\an9}你有行动的计划吗？

576
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,448
Do you have a plan of action?

577
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,406
{\an9}冲进去 找到它的心脏或者大脑什么的

578
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,406
Get inside, find its heart or brain or whatever,

579
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,490
{\an9}-然后 你知道的 动手 我的意思是…

580
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,490
-and then, you know, do it in. KID LOKI: I mean. . .

581
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,375
{\an9}计划简单 不代表计划不行

582
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,375
Just because it's not complicated doesn't mean it's bad.

583
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,166
{\an9}也不代表它就可行

584
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,166
It also doesn't mean it's good.

585
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,906
{\an9}看 他表示赞同

586
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,906
See? He's on board.

587
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:35,041
{\an9}他那是在祈祷 他觉得我们都要死了

588
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:35,041
He's praying. He thinks we're going to die.

589
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,500
{\an9}所有人准备战斗

590
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,500
SAILOR: All hands to battle stations!

591
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,698
{\an9}艾里奥斯和其它动物一样

592
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,698
Alioth is like any animal.

593
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,750
{\an9}他会先去追逐那些大型的猎物

594
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,750
He'll go after the big meal first.

595
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,625
{\an9}在它忙于那些的时候 我们就可以潜到它背后 然后…

596
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,625
And while he's busy with that, we can sneak around the back and. . .

597
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,916
{\an9}开火

598
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,916
Fire!

599
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,156
{\an9}好吧

600
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,156
Okay.

601
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
{\an9}也许我们…

602
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
Maybe we, uh. . .

603
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,416
{\an9}应该再好好想想 是不是？

604
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,416
think a bit more about this, huh?

605
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,448
{\an9}有辆车

606
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,448
Car.

607
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,198
{\an9}-什么？ 在那边

608
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,198
-What? Along the horizon.

609
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,281
{\an9}是坏事吗？

610
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,281
LOKI: Is that bad?

611
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,906
{\an9}一般都是食人族的强盗

612
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,906
KID LOKI: Well, usually means cannibalistic marauders

613
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,490
{\an9}或者是食人族的海盗

614
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,490
or cannibalistic pirates.

615
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,750
{\an9}真不错

616
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,750
Delightful.

617
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,031
{\an9}他们在放慢速度

618
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,031
Now they're slowing down.

619
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,291
{\an9}-他们在干什么？ 保持警惕

620
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,291
-What are they doing? Just stay on guard.

621
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
{\an9}希尔维

622
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Sylvie.

623
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,115
{\an9}我不理解 他到底是懦弱还是勇敢

624
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,115
I don't understand. Is he a coward or was he being brave?

625
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,125
{\an9}-我也不太确定 来吧

626
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,125
-I'm not too sure. Come on.

627
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,240
{\an9}你还活着

628
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,240
You're alive.

629
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,916
{\an9}发生什么了？你还好吗？

630
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,916
What happened? You okay?

631
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,333
{\an9}莫比乌斯

632
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,333
Mobius!

633
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:20,458
{\an9}-你们怎么… 我们觉得你可能需要援助

634
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:20,458
-How did you. . . We thought you could do with some backup.

635
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,490
{\an9}不 等等 等等 这些是我的朋友

636
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,490
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, these are my friends.

637
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,115
{\an9}好吧 他们是…我该怎么说好呢？

638
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,115
Well, they're, um. . . How best to put this?

639
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,365
{\an9}这是咱们的孩子版 这是咱们的未来版

640
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,365
Us as a child, us in the future,

641
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:38,000
{\an9}这是咱们的短吻鳄版

642
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:38,000
and us as an alligator.

643
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,573
{\an9}最好别去挑战它

644
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,573
It's best not to question it.

645
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,698
{\an9}在这随便扔块石头 砸到的都是洛基

646
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,698
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

647
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,906
{\an9}所以你也在追逐那个巨大的乌云怪物？

648
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,906
So you're all after the giant cloud monster, too, then?

649
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,865
{\an9}我们还没决定怎么杀掉它 但是…

650
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,865
Well, we haven't decided how we're going to kill it, but. . .

651
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,740
{\an9}-再说一遍？杀掉它？ 对 我们要杀掉艾里奥斯

652
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,740
-Come again? Kill it? Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

653
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,448
{\an9}天啊 那是你的计划

654
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,448
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

655
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,281
{\an9}-对 然后你们就这么接受了？

656
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,281
-Yeah. And you went along with it?

657
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,073
{\an9}-我有我的疑虑 可能不太安全

658
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,073
-KID LOKI: I had my doubts. Probably unsafe.

659
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,490
{\an9}好吧 那你的计划是什么？

660
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,490
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

661
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,698
{\an9}我觉得我们要寻找的人 就在虚空之外时间的尽头

662
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,698
I think the person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time.

663
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,781
{\an9}如果他们真的在那

664
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,781
And if they are,

665
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,198
{\an9}这个东西就是守卫着唯一入口的看门狗

666
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,198
that thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.

667
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,448
{\an9}好吧 那我们怎么绕过这只看门狗？

668
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,448
Okay, so, um, how do we get past the guard dog?

669
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,458
{\an9}我要附身在它身上

670
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,458
I'm gonna enchant it.

671
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,281
{\an9}-那太疯狂了吧？ 那还要怎么样？

672
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,281
-That's insane, right? As insane as what?

673
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,156
{\an9}-一刀一刀把乌云砍死？ 听着

674
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,156
-Paper-cutting a cloud to death? Listen,

675
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,583
{\an9}-我来这时间比你长 我要附身在它身上

676
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,583
-I've been down here longer than you. . . I'm going to enchant it.

677
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,833
{\an9}她很自信

678
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,833
She's pretty confident.

679
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,458
{\an9}你们出去吧

680
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,458
Leave us.

681
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,666
{\an9}为什么把我关在这里？

682
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,666
Why am I locked in here?

683
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,531
{\an9}你放走了那个时间犯

684
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,531
You freed the Variant.

685
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,948
{\an9}-你背叛了时间变异管理局 背叛？

686
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,948
-You were disloyal to the TVA. Disloyal?

687
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:22,291
{\an9}-你觉得能逃脱惩罚吗？ 我背叛谁了？

688
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:22,291
-Did you think you'd escape punishment? Disloyal to who?

689
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,823
{\an9}你在时间守护者的房间里 他们不是真实的

690
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,823
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.

691
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,490
{\an9}那又能改变什么？

692
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,490
And why does that change anything?

693
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,781
{\an9}那改变了一切

694
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,781
That changes everything!

695
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,406
{\an9}人们需要知道真相

696
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,406
The people need to know the truth.

697
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,406
{\an9}不 时间变异管理局需要稳定

698
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,406
No, the TVA needs stability.

699
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:37,208
{\an9}在我们弄清楚怎么回事之前 它就必须要这样

700
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:37,208
And until we figure out what's going on, that is what it will get.

701
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:42,500
{\an9}所以你得把一切告诉我

702
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:42,500
So you need to tell me everything.

703
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,125
{\an9}你到底想要从我这得到什么？

704
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,125
What exactly do you want from me?

705
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,031
{\an9}你和那个时间犯有联系

706
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,031
You had a link with the Variant.

707
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,073
{\an9}我需要你告诉我她的动机

708
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,073
I want you to tell me what drives her.

709
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,791
{\an9}她的动机就是复仇

710
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,791
Revenge drives her.

711
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,823
{\an9}杀死时间守护者

712
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,823
Killing the Time-Keepers.

713
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:01,615
{\an9}但是结果他们是假的 你不会忘了吧

714
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:01,615
But they turned out to be fake, in case you forgot.

715
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,000
{\an9}所以她要去寻找创造他们的人

716
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,000
So she'll be searching for whomever created them.

717
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,791
{\an9}这根本不是为了保护时间变异管理局 是不是？

718
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,791
This isn't about protecting the TVA at all, is it?

719
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,166
{\an9}你就是想找到幕后的主使

720
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,166
You just want to find whoever is behind all of this, too.

721
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,323
{\an9}你永远也找不到他们

722
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,323
You'll never find them.

723
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,281
{\an9}至少不会比她先找到

724
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,281
Not before she does.

725
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,291
{\an9}为什么？

726
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,291
And why is that?

727
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,375
{\an9}你只是想找到

728
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,375
You only want it.

729
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,166
{\an9}她是非找到不可

730
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,166
She needs it.

731
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,156
{\an9}你好啊

732
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,156
Hey, y'all.

733
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,406
{\an9}我需要所有时间变异管理局创立的文件

734
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,406
I need all the files on the founding of the TVA.

735
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,365
{\an9}时间起始之后的一切

736
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,365
Everything from the beginning of time.

737
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,156
{\an9}这个要求可有点难办

738
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,156
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

739
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,948
{\an9}这个地方的缔造者正身处险境

740
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,948
Whoever created this place is in danger.

741
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,573
{\an9}我得找到他们

742
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,573
I need to find them.

743
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,666
{\an9}收到 立即行动 长官

744
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,666
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

745
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,823
{\an9}你真的不记得他了吗？

746
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,823
CLASSIC LOKI: You really don't remember him?

747
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,281
{\an9}我的意思是 时间变异管理局 逮捕了很多洛基

748
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,281
MOBIUS: I mean, the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

749
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,948
{\an9}但是 不 我不记得有条短吻鳄

750
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,948
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

751
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,041
{\an9}而且 谁说他是个洛基的时间犯？

752
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,041
I mean, who's to say he's even a Loki Variant?

753
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,573
{\an9}他是绿的 对不对？

754
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,573
He is green, isn't he?

755
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,115
{\an9}我不知道 他可能在撒谎

756
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,115
I don't know, he could be lying.

757
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:40,365
{\an9}隐姓埋名啊 当然 那只会让他更像是个洛基

758
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:40,365
The long con. Of course, that just makes him more likely to be a Loki.

759
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:45,375
{\an9}你们这些家伙总是环环相扣的 这一点我很欣赏

760
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:45,375
It's always the game within the game with you guys, which I respect.

761
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,865
{\an9}莫比乌斯

762
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,865
KID LOKI: Mobius,

763
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,791
{\an9}假设你能回到时间变异管理局

764
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,791
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

765
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,041
{\an9}你到底会去做什么？

766
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,041
what exactly are you getting yourself into?

767
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,615
{\an9}我也不知道

768
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,615
I don't know.

769
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,990
{\an9}我想让人们知道真相

770
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,990
I'd like to let people know the truth.

771
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,323
{\an9}那么做的话 你就背叛了

772
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,323
So just like that, you're turning on the very thing

773
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,323
{\an9}你为之奉献毕生的东西

774
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,323
you devoted your life to.

775
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
{\an9}改变永远不晚

776
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
Well, it's never too late to change.

777
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,166
{\an9}我希望他们知道他们在做什么

778
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,166
I hope they know what they're doing.

779
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,458
{\an9}莫比乌斯没那么坏

780
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,458
Mobius isn't so bad.

781
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,490
{\an9}也没那么好

782
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,490
Or so good.

783
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,208
{\an9}我觉得这就是我们合得来的原因

784
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,208
I think that's why we get along.

785
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,916
{\an9}他很关心你

786
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,916
He cares about you.

787
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,083
{\an9}有点冷

788
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,083
-It's cold. Mmm-hmm.

789
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,541
{\an9}如果你愿意的话 我可以给你变一个

790
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,541
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

791
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,240
{\an9}我说 你还不如给我变一件新的外衣

792
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,240
You could conjure me a new outfit.

793
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,666
{\an9}你可不知道这件有多不舒服

794
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,666
You have no idea how uncomfortable something like this is.

795
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,281
{\an9}所以…

796
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,281
So. . .

797
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:17,198
{\an9}关于莫比乌斯和他的理论…

798
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:17,198
Mobius and his theory about. . .

799
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,365
{\an9}对 对 关于我们的关连事件

800
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,365
Right, right. About our nexus event.

801
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,115
{\an9}-都是胡说 对吧？ 绝对是 肯定是 我是说…

802
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,115
-Total rubbish, right? Absolutely. Of course. I mean. . .

803
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,281
{\an9}我并不觉得那个时刻有什么不好

804
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,281
I don't mean that it wasn't a nice moment.

805
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,323
{\an9}对 那个时刻棒极了 非常好

806
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,323
No, it was great. It was really nice.

807
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,531
{\an9}听上去像是又一个 时间变异管理局的谎言

808
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,531
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

809
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:33,583
{\an9}百分之百 我觉得肯定是

810
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:33,583
A hundred percent. I mean, totally. Yeah.

811
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,865
{\an9}我不知道该怎么处理

812
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,865
I don't know how to do this.

813
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,416
{\an9}我甚至都不知道咱们在干什么

814
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,416
I don't even know what we're doing.

815
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,375
{\an9}我没有朋友

816
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,375
I don't have friends.

817
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,166
{\an9}我没有…

818
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,166
I don't have. . .

819
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,031
{\an9}任何人在身边

820
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,031
anyone.

821
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,698
{\an9}好吧…

822
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,698
Well. . .

823
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,240
{\an9}你有更重要的事要做 对吗？

824
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,240
there are more important things, right?

825
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,448
{\an9}是吗？对 比如推翻时间变异管理局

826
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,448
Right? Yeah. Like bringing down the TVA.

827
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,073
{\an9}甚至是拯救宇宙

828
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,073
Saving the universe, even.

829
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,791
{\an9}不用这么夸张 但是 算是吧

830
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,791
Well, there's no need to be dramatic, but, yeah, kind of.

831
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,198
{\an9}这不是很舒服

832
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,198
It's not very snuggly.

833
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,198
{\an9}-好吧 这是桌布吗？

834
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,198
Okay. Is it a tablecloth?

835
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,958
{\an9}不 这是个毯子

836
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,958
No, it's a blanket.

837
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,666
{\an9}谢谢你

838
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,666
Thank you.

839
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,416
{\an9}不客气

840
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,416
My pleasure.

841
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,948
{\an9}我怎么能确定 在最后的时刻 你不会背叛我？

842
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,948
How do I know that, in the final moments, you won't betray me?

843
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,250
{\an9}听着 希尔维 我…

844
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,250
Listen, Sylvie, I. . .

845
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,583
{\an9}我背叛了所有爱过我的人

846
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,583
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

847
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,041
{\an9}我背叛了我的父亲 我的哥哥…

848
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,041
I betrayed my father, my brother. . .

849
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,416
{\an9}还有我的家园

850
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,416
my home.

851
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,666
{\an9}我知道我的所作所为

852
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,666
I know what I did.

853
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,750
{\an9}而且我知道为什么要那么做

854
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,750
And I know why I did it.

855
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,250
{\an9}那已经不是现在的我了

856
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,250
And that's not who I am anymore.

857
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,833
{\an9}好吗？

858
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,833
Okay?

859
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,333
{\an9}我不会让你失望的

860
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,333
I won't let you down.

861
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
{\an9}你确定吗？

862
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
You sure?

863
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,541
{\an9}因为如果我们成功了 时间变异管理局不在了

864
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,541
'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone,

865
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,625
{\an9}就会有一条时间线交给你来主宰

866
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,625
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

867
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,708
{\an9}那我总算可以满足了

868
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,708
Ah. And then I'd finally be happy.

869
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
{\an9}那你呢？

870
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
What about you?

871
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,791
{\an9}这一切结束以后 你要去做什么？

872
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,791
What will you do when this is all over?

873
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
{\an9}我不知道

874
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I don't know.

875
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,291
{\an9}我也不知道

876
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,291
I don't know either.

877
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,250
{\an9}也许

878
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,250
Maybe. . .

879
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,416
{\an9}也许我们可以…

880
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,416
Maybe we could figure it out. . .

881
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,666
{\an9}一起弄明白

882
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,666
together.

883
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,250
{\an9}也许吧

884
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,250
Maybe.

885
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,531
{\an9}好吧 下一步怎么做？

886
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,531
Okay, so what's the next move?

887
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,531
{\an9}我们要推翻时间变异管理局

888
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,531
SYLVIE: The TVA needs to be brought down.

889
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,823
{\an9}我们不知道是谁创造了它 也不知道他们在哪里

890
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,823
We don't know who created it or where they are,

891
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,490
{\an9}但是那个东西知道

892
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,490
but that thing out there does.

893
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,198
{\an9}之前它攻击我的时候 我和它连接了

894
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,198
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.

895
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,365
{\an9}时间很短 但是那一瞬间我看到了

896
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,365
It was brief, but I caught a glimpse of something,

897
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,531
{\an9}如果足够接近 我就能附身在它身上

898
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,531
and I think if I can get close enough to it, I can enchant it,

899
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:20,416
{\an9}这样就能找出真正的幕后主使

900
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:20,416
and it's gonna take me to whoever's behind all of this.

901
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,875
{\an9}我要留下来

902
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,875
I'm staying.

903
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:44,916
{\an9}-洛基 我不知道能不能成功 你去 我就去

904
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:44,916
-Loki, I don't know if this is gonna work. You go, I go.

905
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,031
{\an9}快要出现了 伙计们 分支就在那里

906
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,031
It's happening, guys. The branch will be right out there.

907
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,948
{\an9}我会替你向洛斯蕾尔问好的

908
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,948
MOBIUS: I'll give your regards to Renslayer.

909
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,281
{\an9}请务必把我的问候带到

910
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,281
Oh, please do.

911
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,115
{\an9}你们想从这出去吗？

912
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,115
You boys want a ticket out of here?

913
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,698
{\an9}什么？不 我们要留在这里

914
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,698
What? No. We're staying here.

915
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,781
{\an9}这是我们的家

916
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,781
This is our home.

917
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,448
{\an9}你们确定吗？那艾里奥斯呢？

918
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,448
Are you sure? What about Alioth?

919
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,781
{\an9}我们已经活了这么久了 我们知道该怎么做

920
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,781
We've survived this long. We know what we're doing.

921
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,531
{\an9}洛基 你的旅途上需要这个

922
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,531
Loki, you're gonna need this on your journey.

923
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,541
{\an9}拿着吧

924
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,541
Go on.

925
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,531
{\an9}祝你们好运

926
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,531
CLASSIC LOKI: Good luck.

927
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,458
{\an9}希望你们能得偿所望

928
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,458
I hope you find what you're looking for.

929
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:49,125
{\an9}看来你最后还是脱身了

930
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:49,125
Looks like you got away in the end.

931
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,083
{\an9}我一贯如此

932
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,083
I always do.

933
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,000
{\an9}回到时间变异管理局以后 你要干什么？

934
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,000
What will you do at the TVA?

935
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:00,375
{\an9}把它烧成灰烬

936
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:00,375
Burn it to the ground.

937
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,000
{\an9}感谢你的星星之火

938
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,000
Thanks for the spark.

939
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,666
{\an9}回头见 洛基

940
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,666
Well, see you later, Loki.

941
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,833
{\an9}谢谢你 我的朋友

942
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,833
Thank you, my friend.

943
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,166
{\an9}你是我的最爱

944
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,166
You're my favorite.

945
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,615
{\an9}分支出现的时候 就会吸引艾里奥斯的注意力

946
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,615
SYLVIE: When a branch appears, Alioth will focus on it.

947
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,083
{\an9}那就是我附身的机会

948
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,083
That's when I'll enchant it.

949
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,281
{\an9}如果我们没有时间等待分支出现呢？

950
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,281
What if we don't have time to wait for a branch?

951
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,208
{\an9}咱们得分散它的注意力

952
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,208
We'll have to cause a distraction.

953
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,750
{\an9}来啊 抓我啊

954
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,750
Come and get me!

955
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,198
{\an9}不 来这边

956
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,198
LOKI: No! This way!

957
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,750
{\an9}来抓我啊

958
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,750
Come and get me!

959
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,125
{\an9}不 不

960
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,125
No! No!

961
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,916
{\an9}他是怎么做到的？

962
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,916
How is he doing that?

963
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,500
{\an9}我觉得我们比想象的更强大

964
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,500
I think we're stronger than we realize.

965
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,000
{\an9}上吧

966
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,000
Go!

967
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,115
{\an9}你在干什么？

968
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,115
What are you doing?

969
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,156
{\an9}我们要附身在它身上

970
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,156
SYLVIE: We're gonna enchant it.

971
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,948
{\an9}我不知道怎么做

972
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,948
LOKI: I don't know how.

973
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,073
{\an9}你知道

974
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,073
SYLVIE: You do.

975
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,708
{\an9}因为咱们是一样的

976
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,708
Because we're the same!

977
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,333
{\an9}这是光荣的使命

978
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,333
Glorious purpose!

979
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,000
{\an9}睁开眼吧

980
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,000
Open your eyes.

981
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,250
