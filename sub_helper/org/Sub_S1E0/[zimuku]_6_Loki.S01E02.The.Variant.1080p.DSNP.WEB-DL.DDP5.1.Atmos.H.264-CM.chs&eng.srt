1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,990
代表时间变异管理局
HUNTER B-15: On behalf
of the Time Variance Authority,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,042
我以侵犯神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你
I hereby arrest you
for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,708
前情提要

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,948
很久以前 全知全能的
时间守护者出现了
MISS MINUTES: Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,

5
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:22,782
他们创造了神圣时间线
creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.

6
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,823
有时 会有像你一样的人偏离常规路径
Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:29,500
这些人就是时间犯
We call those Variants.

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,865
劳菲森 你有何申辩？
Laufeyson, how do you plead?

9
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,740
-我是莫比乌斯探员
-你在这多长时间了
-I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.
-How long have you been here?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,490
我不知道 很难说
时间变异管理局的时间流动不太一样
MOBIUS: I don't know. It's hard to say,
time passes differently here in the TVA.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,198
你们在这里走来走去
Now, you parade about

12
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,740
仿佛自己是宇宙中至高无上的仲裁
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,282
无限原石？
LOKI: Infinity Stones?

14
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,073
有些人拿来做镇纸
Some of the guys
use 'em as paperweights.

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,042
这里是全宇宙最强大的力量吗？
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,573
我回不去了 是不是？
LOKI: I can't go back, can I?
MOBIUS: I can't offer you salvation,

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,448
我不能给你救赎

18
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,532
但是也许我可以给你更好的
but maybe I can offer
you something better.

19
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:04,407
一个在逃的时间犯在杀害我们的时间卫士
A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

20
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:08,417
你需要诡计之神来帮你制止他？
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,240
为什么是我？
Why me?

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,490
因为我们在追捕的时间犯就是...
MOBIUS: The Variant we're hunting is...

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,542
你
You.

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,615
威斯康星州 奥什科什

25
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,240
1985年

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,958
许个愿
CHILD: Make a wish.

27
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,698
你好 怎么回事？
Hi! What's going on?

28
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,115
你们的打扮可不对
You guys aren't dressed right.

29
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,573
那么...
I... So...

30
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,657
发现时间犯
时间变异管理局

31
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,250
发现时间犯 指挥官
MINUTEMAN: Variant detected, Commander.

32
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,750
开始行动
Let's move.

33
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,167
这可是我们的要求
Some of us need this, you know.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,667
还没有关连事件能量 长官
MINUTEMAN: No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,948
这是个陷阱 小心背后
HUNTER C-20: It's a trap.
Watch your backs!

36
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,240
我的主人 亲爱的女士们 欢迎前来
ANNOUNCER: My lords, my ladies, welcome

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,615
欢迎在城堡里加入我们的行列
and thank you for joining us,
here at the castle.

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:16,573
请在座位上坐好
一场大战即将开始
Please, settle into your seats
for a great battle is about to commence.

39
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,740
奖励是什么？我们的公主
The prize? Our princess.

40
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,375
究竟是邪恶的一方获胜
还是我们能坚持到英雄降临
Will evil prevail,
or are we holding out for a hero?

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,417
指挥官？
MINUTEMAN: Commander?

42
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:55,782
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the Gods?

43
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,782
Where's the streetwise
Hercules to fight...

44
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,157
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

45
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,583
这样才好玩
Having some fun.

46
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:09,125
Isn't there a white knight
Upon a fiery steed?

47
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:14,865
Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need

48
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,157
I need a hero

49
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,583
I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night

50
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,198
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

51
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,490
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,250
I need a hero

53
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,167
运行程序 - 时间门
I'm holding out for a hero
'Till the morning light

54
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,198
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon

55
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:41,417
And he's gotta be larger than life

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,833
I need a hero!

57
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,323
力量 性能 质量
MISS MINUTES: Okay, y'all,
let's review what we've learned.

58
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,615
好的 各位 让我们来回顾一下咱们学到的

59
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,667
当关连事件分支超出红线时
会发生什么？
What happens when a nexus event
branches past red line?

60
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,323
非常糟糕的事情
Very bad things.

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,667
正经点 洛基 是什么？
Come on, Loki. What is it?

62
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,282
时间变异管理局将无法
重置关连事件
It's when the TVA can
no longer reset a nexus event.

63
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,282
行了吗？太无聊了
Okay? Boring.

64
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,573
没错 而且那会导致时间线的毁灭
Right. And that would lead
to the destruction of the timeline

65
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,282
还有我们所知的现实的崩溃
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

66
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,907
你能听到我说话吗？
Can you hear me?

67
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,708
你是录制好的 还是有生命的？
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

68
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,000
两者都是吧
Uh, sorta both. Ah.

69
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,333
注意点 懂不懂礼貌？
Watch it! Where's your manners?

70
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,865
住手
Oh! Hey! Quit it!

71
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,240
你这个坏人 混蛋
That is not nice. Jerk.

72
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,198
-别躲
-训练怎么样？
-You can't hide...
-MOBIUS: Training goin' well?

73
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,782
-挺好的
-那是我的摩托艇杂志吗？
-Yeah.
-Is that my jet ski magazine?

74
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,990
给我放下 穿上衣服
Put it down. Gear up.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,542
发生袭击了 跟我来
There's been an attack. Let's go.

76
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,792
穿上
Put it on.

77
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:09,032
不错呀 挺帅
Good. Yeah. Smart.

78
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,698
威斯康星州 奥什科什 - 1985年
威胁级别 高

79
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,365
C-20和她的小队一起失联了
C-20 and her team went dark

80
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,365
就在他们进入1985年的分支后不久
shortly after they jumped
into the 1985 branch.

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,365
所有迹象都指向又一次伏击
All signs point to another ambush.

82
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,615
我们收集了足够多的现世光环证明
就是时间犯洛基
We've grabbed enough temporal aura
to know it's our Loki Variant.

83
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,948
但是是什么类型的洛基 还不得而知
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

84
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,000
肯定是更低等的
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

85
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,000
给我看看你的衣服背面
Let me see
the back of that jacket.

86
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,667
时间犯
Hmm.

87
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,115
很隐蔽啊 干得好
Very subtle. Well done.

88
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,865
我可不想让大家忘了你的身份
I don't want anybody out there
to forget what you are.

89
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,615
你们抓住杀人凶手的救命稻草？
Oh, your only hope
of capturing a murderer?

90
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,448
当然不是 你是个巨大的错误
No. A cosmic mistake.

91
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,198
-够了
-谢谢
-That's enough.
-Lovely.

92
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,282
咱们说好了
MOBIUS: Here's the deal.

93
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,698
当我们进入分支时
When we get out on the branch,

94
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,657
我们要找的不只是时间罪犯
we're not just
looking for a Time Criminal.

95
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,073
还有洛基的踪迹
We're looking for a Loki.

96
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,573
这家伙的变异体
A variation of this guy.

97
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,990
他是我们的老对手
A type we should
all be very familiar with,

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,073
因为时间变异管理局
已经裁剪过这家伙很多次了
because the TVA
has pruned a lotta these guys,

99
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,157
比其他任何时间犯都要多
almost more than any other Variant.

100
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,740
他们各不相同
And no two are alike.

101
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,198
有时外貌差别不大 有时差别挺大
Slight differences in appearances,
or not so slight.

102
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,782
虽然他们能力不同
但是基本是这几样
Different powers, although,
powers, generally include

103
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,907
变幻外形 制造幻象
还有我最欣赏的...
shape-shifting,
illusion-projection, and my favorite...

104
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,833
那是制造分身
Duplication-casting.

105
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,615
是制造幻象
Illusion-projection.

106
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,615
不对 这两个能力完全不同
No, they're two
completely different powers.

107
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,782
怎么不同了
How?

108
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,448
制造幻象是从外部描绘细节图像
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,

109
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,448
是外部世界能分辨的
which is perceptible
in the external world,

110
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,782
而制造分身则需要
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating

111
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,323
在现有环境里完全复制整个身体
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,

112
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,907
可以说是分子结构的真实镜像
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.

113
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,365
但是这你们都知道了
But you already knew that.

114
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,282
好吧 喘口气 我知道了
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

115
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:51,282
我们要分成两队 我和洛基教授也要去
We're gonna break into two teams,
including myself and Professor Loki.

116
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,333
为什么？
Why?

117
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,240
因为不管这个时间犯是谁 我们一直找不到他
Because whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

118
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,000
所以这次得专家出场
So let's bring in an expert.

119
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,375
那就是我了
That's me.

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,448
-我有武器吗？
-没有
-Do I get a weapon?
-Nah.

121
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,282
好吧 我又能用魔法了 没人担心吗？
Well, I'll have my magic back.
Is no one concerned about that?

122
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,240
-担心什么？
-担心我背叛你
-Of what?
-Me betraying you.

123
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,532
-没有
-为什么没有？
-No.
-Why not?

124
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,948
你知道我们总能抓住你
You know that we can catch you.

125
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:17,167
而且背叛我们你还怎么接近时间守护者？
And how's betraying us gonna get you
any closer to the Time-Keepers?

126
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,865
我有机会见到时间守护者？
An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

127
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,208
你可以试试
Keep that focus.

128
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,000
已到达关连事件标记峰值 长官
Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,323
我有个问题
Let me ask you this,

130
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,782
为什么我们不能回到攻击发生之前
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,

131
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,407
回到时间犯最初出现的时候？
when the Variant first arrives?

132
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,365
关连事件导致时间流不稳定
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

133
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,698
这个分支还在不断变化加剧
所以你只能按照实际时间出现
This branch is still changing and growing,
so you gotta show up in real time.

134
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,157
该看的训练视频你看了吗？
Did you watch any of the training videos
you were supposed to?

135
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,032
我尽可能地忍着看了
Well, as many as I could stand.

136
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,073
时间变异管理局的这些宣传材料太无聊了
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

137
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,292
那这些是干什么的？
And what do these do?

138
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,698
重置器可以裁剪掉分支时间线上受影响的区域
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,

139
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,573
这样时间就可以自愈
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

140
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,865
说白了就是
Which sounds like a nice way

141
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,365
把周围一切解体
换个好听的说法
of saying disintegrate
everything in its vicinity.

142
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,907
他上道了
He's on it.

143
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,448
我可是看了视频的
I watched the videos.

144
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,625
多少看了点吧
I mean, some of them.

145
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:12,865
他开始挟持人质了？
HUNTER B-15: So he's taking hostages now?

146
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,073
这个时间犯从来没有挟持过人质
MOBIUS: The Variant's never
taken a hostage before.

147
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,615
也许他开始变本加厉了
HUNTER B-15: Maybe he's upping his game.

148
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,073
要不就是他裁剪了她
MINUTEMAN: Or he pruned her.

149
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,115
洛基肯定打不过C-20
HUNTER B-15: A Loki couldn't
have gotten the jump on C-20.

150
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,073
其实我觉得你低估了...
I think you underestimate, actually...

151
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,823
散开队形 开始搜寻
Fan out and search for her.

152
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,907
加快速度
And hurry up,

153
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:27,490
我们离红线还差三格
we're at three units until red line.

154
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,375
-开始吧 她说的没错
-来吧
MINUTEMAN: Let's go. She's right.
MOBIUS: Come on.

155
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
等等
Wait...

156
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,125
你们要是离开这个帐篷
就会和他们下场一样
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.

157
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,125
你发现什么了？
What do you see?

158
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,625
我发现了一个阴谋
I see a scheme,

159
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,167
在那个阴谋里 我发现了我自己
and in that scheme, I see myself.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,667
阿斯加德有句谚语
We have a saying in Asgard,

161
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:03,157
狼耳所现之处 狼牙伺机而动
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."

162
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,823
意思是你要时刻警惕周围的环境
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

163
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,198
这其实很荒谬 因为我们族人天生就是
上当受骗的笨蛋
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.

164
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,907
我作为诡计之神
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

165
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,698
一次又一次地利用他们的这个弱点
一听就知道
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.

166
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,240
我的牙齿很锐利
但是我的耳朵更加锐利
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.

167
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,532
我们没有时间了 莫比乌斯
We're running out of time, Mobius.

168
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,115
等等 给他一个机会
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

169
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,115
你让我想起了他们
LOKI: You remind me of them.

170
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,657
时间变异管理局和阿斯加德的众神
是一路货色
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

171
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,115
醉心于权力 却无视真相
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

172
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,573
那些你低估的人会吞噬你
Those you underestimate will devour you.

173
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,073
你低估我
You underestimate me,

174
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,115
就像你低估这个低等洛基一样
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.

175
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,157
这就是为什么你们一次又一次地
自投罗网
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.

176
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,990
只剩两格了 他这是浪费时间
-Two units. He is wasting our time.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,990
好吧 快点 洛基 长话短说
Okay. Come on, Loki,
make a long story short.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,532
我们得找到C-20
HUNTER B-15: We need to look for C-20.

179
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:50,333
这就是时间犯的目的
That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.

180
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,990
这是个圈套
他就在帐篷外边等着你
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,532
我要收回重置器吗？
Should I secure the reset charges?

182
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,740
不用 他要找的是我
我是他计划的关键
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

183
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,032
-他知道我更强大
-就快剩一格了
-He knows that I'm stronger.
-Almost one unit.

184
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,365
而且他非常确定 我们一起
可以推翻并且掌管时间变异管理局
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

185
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,240
但是那不是我想要的
我有了一个新的目标
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.

186
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,865
我是神圣时间线的奴仆
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

187
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,865
我现在知道了他的策略
And knowing
what I now know about his tactics,

188
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,083
我可以把这个时间犯抓回来
I can deliver you the Variant,

189
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,240
但是我需要保证
but I need assurances.

190
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,698
什么保证？
Yeah?

191
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,115
保证任务完成的那一刻
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated

192
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,157
我不会被完全解体
the moment the job has been done.

193
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,365
好啊
Right...

194
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,657
咱们得立刻去见时间守护者
We'll need to speak
to the Time-Keepers at once.

195
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,125
他们所处的危险远超想象
They're in graver danger than we realized.

196
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,657
他在说谎 逗我们玩呢
He's lying. Just playing games.

197
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,907
外面根本没人
There's no one out there.

198
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,333
重置时间线
HUNTER B-15: Reset the timeline.

199
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,323
我差点就信了
You had me for a second.

200
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,792
我的耳朵也很锐利
My ears are sharp too.

201
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,615
时间线重置

202
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,750
追捕者C-20 失踪

203
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,167
是我的错觉吗 还是这个办公室
变得越来越豪华了？
MOBIUS: Is it just me, or does this office
keep getting better and better?

204
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,990
那个是从哪弄来的 那个下雪水晶球？
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,115
这些真不错
I love those.

206
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,407
我不记得带回来过那个盒子
I don't remember bringing back that case.

207
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,708
为我工作的分析师又不止你一个
You're not the only analyst
working for me.

208
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,282
但是我是不是你最喜欢的那个？
But, would you say,
maybe, I'm your favorite one?

209
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,407
为什么你要把我的战利品都拿走？
And why do you get to keep all
the trophies from my cases in here?

210
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,698
你不知道我喜欢用那个溜冰鞋
You don't think I'd love
having that roller skate

211
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,490
来美化我的书架吗？
there sprucing up my cubicle?

212
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,157
因为那些行动是我负责的
Because I approve the missions.

213
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,282
说得没错
Good point.

214
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:10,625
正好 咱们聊聊你刚刚搞砸的那个行动吧
Speaking of which,
let's talk about the one you just botched.

215
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,782
咱们聊天可少不了这个
You might need this for our discussion.

216
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,323
再多点就更好了
I hope it's a double.

217
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:21,365
这个时间犯是
我行我素 冥顽不化 难以预料
This Variant is...
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

218
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,198
听上去和某人一样
Sounds like someone else I know.

219
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,750
我也觉得和某人很像
I was just thinking
it sounds like someone I know.

220
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,698
-莫比乌斯？
-怎么？
-Mobius?
-What?

221
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,615
那些水印原来就有
Those rings were already there.

222
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,407
都是你弄的
And they're all from you.

223
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:38,417
没准是另一个你喜欢的分析师弄的
Maybe it's from
your other favorite analyst.

224
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,532
听着 拉芙娜 我很抱歉
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

225
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,032
我知道我对待
I realize that my, you know,

226
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,657
这个洛基的方式有争议 但是...
methods with this Loki
are controversial, but...

227
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:49,032
把一个危险的时间犯带去行动是有争议的
Towing a dangerous Variant
into the field is controversial.

228
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,657
对 今天就并非完全如我所愿
Yeah, it didn't go exactly
the way I wanted it to today,

229
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,365
但是我们发现了一点
but here's what we did find out.

230
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,282
这个时间犯喜欢拖延时间
The Variant likes to stall for time,

231
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,157
最终我们肯定会抓住另一个
有同样习惯的人
and, eventually, we'll catch
the other one doing the same thing.

232
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:00,782
因为了解这个洛基能够帮助我接近
Because understanding
this Loki helps me get closer

233
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,407
我们正在追捕的那个 不是吗？
to the one we're chasing. Right?

234
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,657
我知道你是个心慈手软的人
Look, I know you have
a soft spot for broken things.

235
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,282
-我不这么觉得
-你就是这样
-I don't think so.
-Yes, you do.

236
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,323
但是洛基就是个邪恶的
满嘴谎言的祸害
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

237
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,865
他在神圣时间线上就是这种货色
That is the part he plays
on the Sacred Timeline.

238
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,490
也许他想改头换面呢
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

239
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,698
有时你也会厌倦一成不变的
Sometimes you get tired
of playing the same part.

240
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,907
这有可能吗？他能改变吗？
Is that possible? He can change?

241
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,490
除非时间守护者裁决 否则不可能
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

242
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,823
到那个时候 该怎么样就怎么样
And then, it shall be so.

243
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,083
时间守护者那边怎么样？
-And how are the old Time-Keepers?
-

244
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,073
你觉得呢？
How do you think?

245
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,323
我不知道 因为我从来没见过他们
I don't know.
'Cause I've never met 'em.

246
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,282
谢天谢地 虽然我不该这么说
Thankfully. Although,
I shouldn't say that.

247
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,407
它看上去...
That one looks...

248
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,240
时间守护者监控着这个案件的每个环节
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

249
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,740
我从没见过他们这么在意
I've never seen them so involved.

250
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,448
他们想要抓住那个时间犯
They want that Variant caught.

251
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,032
我也一样
So do I.

252
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,948
这是你和这个洛基在一起最后的机会
And this is the last chance
you're gonna get with this Loki.

253
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,792
没问题 这就足够了

254
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,792
谢谢你 洛斯蕾尔
Thank you, R Slayer.

255
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,282
富兰克林 D 罗斯福高中

256
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,490
这个我也没印象
I don't remember this.

257
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,282
这肯定是你喜欢的那个分析师给的
This must be from that analyst
you keep on the side.

258
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,823
别胡思乱想
Stay focused.

259
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,333
我专注着呢
Eyes on the road.

260
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,157
莫比乌斯？
RAVONNA: Mobius?

261
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,032
我差点就走了
I was almost gone.

262
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,750
你真的相信这个时间犯吗？
You really believe in this Variant?

263
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,240
幸运的是 对于咱俩而言
他足够相信自己
Mmm... Luckily, he believes in himself
enough for the both of us.

264
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,865
而且如果行不通 我会亲手删除他
And, hey, if it doesn't work,
I'll delete him myself.

265
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,458
他真的很自负
He's really arrogant.

266
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,875
你可能想知道任务中到底是怎么回事
You're probably wondering
what happened out on the mission.

267
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,532
那就是你抓住洛基的第一课
That was your first lesson
in catching a Loki.

268
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,573
掌控他人的预期
Expect the expected.

269
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,198
欺骗一半的乐趣来自于
Half the fun of being a trickster

270
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,782
知道大家都知道你是骗子 然后
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,

271
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,740
很多骗术就可以基于
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting

272
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,823
-你知道他们知道这个事实…
-行了 闭嘴吧！
-the fact that you know that they know...
-Okay. Just shut up!

273
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,490
拜托 那个之前和我一起坐电梯的人呢？
Please. What happened
to the guy I met on the elevator?

274
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,240
那人不爱说话 你记得吗？
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?

275
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,532
怎么就变成现在这样了
Now I'm stuck with this guy

276
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,157
没完没了地唠叨洛基的动机
who won't stop yacking away
about what makes a Loki tick!

277
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,448
什么意思？ 这不就是我该干的吗？
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

278
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,115
不是 你什么动机我不关心
No. I don't care what makes you tick.

279
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,907
你得帮我抓到更高等的你
You're here to help me catch
the superior version of yourself.

280
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,990
-这就够了
-等等
-That's it!
-Hang on.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,573
“更高等”这个词用得不恰当吧
I'm not sure "superior"
is actually quite the right word.

282
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,365
你看？又来了 就是这样
See? There it is. Right there.

283
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,948
我愚蠢地认为
I believed, stupidly,

284
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,740
那种需要证明自己的不安全感
会让你有动力抓到凶手
that insecure need for validation
would motivate you to find the killer.

285
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,615
不是因为你在乎时间变异管理局的任务
或者愿意当什么英雄
Not 'cause you care about
the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

286
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:25,083
而是因为你知道这个时间犯比你厉害
你接受不了这个事实
but because you know this Variant
is better than you and you can't take it.

287
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,865
说得好
Very nice.

288
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:35,698
我的意思是 想要操控我
你也太天真了
I mean, it is adorable that you think
you could possibly manipulate me.

289
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,490
我至少比你多算计十步
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

290
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,833
我可一直有我自己的打算
I've been playing a game
of my own all along.

291
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,823
你想干嘛？在时间守护者面前花言巧语
What, charm your way
in front of the Time-Keepers,

292
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,490
哄骗他们 然后控制时间变异管理局？
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

293
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,157
我猜得对吗？
Am I getting warm?

294
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,615
史上最厉害的骗子的经典骗术
A double cross
by history's most reliable liar.

295
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,657
好吧 那你为什么在里面
还要为我冒险担保？
Okay. Why are you in there
sticking your neck out for me?

296
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,865
我给你两个原因
I'll give you two options,

297
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,823
你爱信哪个信哪个
and you can believe
whichever one you want.

298
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,698
其一 因为我看到一个被吓坏的小男孩
在寒风中瑟瑟发抖
A, because I see a scared
little boy, shivering in the cold.

299
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,073
谁还没点恻隐之心呢
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.

300
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,782
或者其二 我就是想抓住那家伙
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,

301
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,042
所以该告诉你的
我一字不差地告诉你
and I'll tell you whatever
I need to tell you.

302
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,282
我不需要你的怜悯
I don't need your sympathy.

303
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:18,167
好极了 因为我的怜悯也快没了
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

304
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,032
什么意思？
这是为了操控我的下一步...
What's this?
Next step of your manipulation...

305
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,157
这是最后一步 你最后的机会
This is the final step.
Your last chance.

306
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:27,032
我最后的机会需要干点什么？
Oh, and what does my desperate
last chance require?

307
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,240
干活
Work.

308
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,375
干活？
Work?

309
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,573
我需要你去重新看一遍
每个时间犯的卷宗
I need you to go over each
and every one of the Variant's case files,

310
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,448
然后 给我你的... 怎么说来着？
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

311
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,782
你独特的洛基视角
Your unique Loki perspective.

312
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,240
谁知道呢？
没准我们真有漏看的东西
And who knows?
Maybe there's something that we missed.

313
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,865
你们这群笨蛋
漏掉的东西肯定不少
Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.

314
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,573
要不说有你在算我走运呢
That's why I'm lucky
I got ya for a little bit longer.

315
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,032
你就在这开始吧
Let me park ya at this desk.

316
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,573
一定要不辞辛劳全情投入
And don't be afraid
to really lean into this work.

317
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,073
给你个小建议
Here's a good trick for you.

318
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,865
就当这份工作攸关性命
Pretend your life depends on it.

319
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,083
我去吃点东西
I'm gonna get a snack.

320
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,782
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

321
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:37,375
这个时间犯不会又偷袭杀害了
一队时间卫士吧
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed
and killed another team of Minutemen.

322
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,208
而且还又偷走了重置器
And stole
their reset charge as well.

323
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,833
Shh.

324
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,458
Shh.

325
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,000
嗨
Hi.

326
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,000
你好？
Hello?

327
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,198
需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

328
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,573
是的 我正在进行
重要的时间变异管理局工作
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.

329
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,948
我跟着他们一起外出行动
你知道行动是什么样的
Follow-up to a field mission.
You know how it goes.

330
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,282
那个红线就快到峰值了…
We red lined near the apex, and...

331
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,375
好吧 这行不通

332
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:43,583
我需要所有关于
时间变异管理局创立的文件
Um, I'd like all files pertaining
to the creation of the TVA, please.

333
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,500
那些是机密
Those are classified.

334
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,865
好吧 那就给我所有
关于时间起始的文件吧
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining
to the beginning of time then.

335
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,907
-那些是机密
-好吧 时间尽头的也行
-Those are classified.
-Okay, the end of time.

336
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,208
-那些是机密
-好吧 什么文件我能看？
-Those are classified.
-Okay, what files can I have?

337
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,875
祝你读得开心
Happy reading.

338
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,625
时间犯卷宗
姓名：劳菲森 洛基

339
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,125
时间查询
阿斯加德毁灭事件 细节

340
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,250
诸神的黄昏（七级末日）

341
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,615
星球完全毁灭

342
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,375
没有检测到时间犯能量
取代时间

343
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:50,292
整个文明灭绝

344
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:56,417
伤亡人数 9719

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,208
没有检测到时间犯能量
取代时间

346
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,782
我发现了些东西
I found something.

347
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,657
不对 我说过了
“在读完所有卷宗前别来烦我”
No, I said, "Don't bother me
until you've read all the files."

348
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,865
-我读完了
-所有卷宗？
-I have.
-Every file?

349
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,323
-是的
-所有和时间犯有关的？
-Yes.
-Pertaining to the Variant?

350
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,750
答案不在卷宗里 而是在时间线上
The answer isn't in the files,
it's on the timeline.

351
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,240
他藏在末日里
He's hiding in apocalypses.

352
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,532
哪个末日？
Which apocalypse?

353
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,958
历史上随便哪个？
大概得有一百万个吧
Any time in history?
There's, like, a million of 'em.

354
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,157
诸神的黄昏 你知道吗？
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

355
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,157
是的 阿斯加德和几乎
所有子民的覆灭 请节哀
Yes. The destruction of Asgard
and most of its people. I'm sorry.

356
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,823
是的 非常伤感
Yes, very sad.

357
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,167
随便吧 我有个想法…
Anyway, it got me thinking...

358
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
接着说
Go ahead.

359
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,532
关连事件
Nexus events

360
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:58,907
出现是因为某人做了不该做的事 对吗？
happen when someone does something
they're not supposed to do, right?

361
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,532
可能更复杂点 但基本上是吧
Well, it's a little more
complicated, but, yeah.

362
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,448
好 然后他们不该做的那些事
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,

363
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,073
会引发一系列不该发生的连锁反应
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.

364
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,865
然后不断继续
直到出现一个新的时间分支 对吗？
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?

365
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,532
对于既定结果的混乱改动
Chaotic alterations
of a predetermined outcome.

366
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,698
-没错 所以 假设…
-你要干什么？
-Exactly. So, let's just say...
-Mmm-hmm. What are you doing?

367
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,990
你的沙拉就是阿斯加德
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,615
-这不是阿斯加德 这是我的午饭
-我打个比方
-It's not Asgard, that's my lunch.
-It's a metaphor.

369
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,323
-先别急
-我想吃那个沙拉
-Just hang in there.
-I want that salad.

370
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,198
我可以去阿斯加德
And I could go down to Asgard

371
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,115
在诸神的黄昏完全毁灭一切之前
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction

372
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,865
我想干什么就干什么
and I could do anything I wanted.

373
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:38,532
我可以 比如说
把浩克从彩虹桥推下去
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

374
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,907
-他掉下去了
-盐就是浩克？
-There he goes.
-The salt's Hulk?

375
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,698
我还可以…
把宫殿给烧掉
And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.

376
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,990
不要 住手
别把宫殿给烧掉
No, just stop.
Don't set fire to the palace.

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,240
明白了吗？我想干什么就干什么
不会有任何影响
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.

378
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,625
一切都不会违背既定的时间线 因为…
It wouldn't go against the dictates
of the timeline because...

379
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,833
-打扰一下
-天啊！
-Excuse me?
-MOBIUS: Oh, God!

380
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,115
-是你
-很高兴见到你
-You!
-Nice to see you.

381
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,240
借用一下 谢谢
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

382
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,573
因为反正末日就要来了
Because the apocalypse is coming.

383
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,740
诸神的黄昏 无论我做什么
苏尔特尔都会毁灭阿斯加德
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy
Asgard no matter what I do.

384
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,282
不 别毁啊…

385
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,323
-末日到来了
-那是末日吗？
LOKI: There's the apocalypse.
MOBIUS: That's the apocalypse?

386
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:23,083
诸神的黄昏抹掉了盐的存在
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.

387
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,250
诸神的黄昏
Ragnarok.

388
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,282
就是这意思
There it is.

389
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,615
我到底在看什么？
What am I lookin' at?

390
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,573
好吧 这个比喻有点简单粗暴
但是你明白我的意思
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.

391
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,573
无所谓的
可能是任何一个末日
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.

392
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,990
可能是海啸巨浪
可能是陨石
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.

393
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,240
还可能是火山爆发 或者超新星爆炸
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

394
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,240
如果周围的所有人或者事物都注定立刻毁灭
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,

395
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,032
那我说什么或者做什么都无所谓
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

396
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,490
因为时间线不会出现分支
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

397
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,875
因为这条时间线被毁灭了
'Cause it gets destroyed.

398
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:01,240
因此 时间犯可能就藏在末日之中
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse

399
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,000
他可以随心所欲 我们也无从得知
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!

400
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,115
不错
Not bad.

401
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,990
带我去个真的末日 去诸神的黄昏吧 我展示给你看
Take me to a real apocalypse,
to Ragnarok, I'll show you.

402
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,198
好啊 然后你就可以跑回老家去了？你休想
Yeah. So you can run away
back to your homeland? No.

403
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,157
不 我没想回家 咱们去哪都行
No, I'm not going home.
We can go anywhere.

404
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,198
我连海滨公园散步都不会带你去 末日就更别提了
I'm not taking you for a stroll along
the promenade, much less an apocalypse.

405
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,823
莫比乌斯 别这样
Oh, Mobius, come on!

406
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,240
能有什么问题呢？
What could possibly go wrong?

407
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,948
咱们得测试一下这个理论
We gotta properly test this theory.

408
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,490
我倒是有个有趣的理论
Well, here's a fun theory.

409
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,198
你诱惑我外出行动 然后在背后捅我一刀
You lure me out into the field,
and stab me in the back.

410
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,198
这个理论我可不想冒险
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

411
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,032
我从来没在背后捅过人
I'd never stab anyone in the back.

412
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,948
这种背叛也太没创意了
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

413
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,073
洛基 我研究过你这一生的每个时刻
Loki, I've studied almost
every moment of your entire life.

414
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:41,167
你在背后捅人 少说得有五十次
You've literally stabbed
people in the back, like, 50 times.

415
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,292
那我绝对不会再捅了 因为这太老套了
Well, I'd never do it again,
because it got old.

416
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,490
好吧
Okay.

417
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,167
好吧 那这样 你可以不相信我 但是你得相信一点
Okay, look, you don't trust me,
you can trust one thing.

418
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:53,292
我喜欢证明我是对的
I love to be right.

419
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:01,792
意大利 庞贝

420
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:12,417
公元79年

421
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,323
-准备开始了
-随时都有可能
Here we go.
-Shh, any minute now.

422
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,198
整个城镇会被从这个星球抹掉
Until this entire town
is wiped off the face of this planet.

423
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,865
想象一下 那些火山灰…
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

424
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,698
我知道 咱们也不用那么兴奋吧
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

425
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,240
来嘛 多酷啊
Oh, come on! It's cool.

426
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,907
确实很酷 但是不那么好受 因为...
No, it is cool, but it's just
not in good taste because...

427
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,532
反正他们怎么着都会死
They're all gonna die anyway.

428
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:32,407
我知道 听我说 我就盯着传送器上的变异能量
I know. Now listen, I'm gonna watch
the TemPad for any variance energy.

429
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,615
-好的
-好的 因为我们得小心行事
-Okay.
-Okay, because we gotta be careful.

430
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,948
如果你错了 而且很有可能你会错
If you're wrong,
and there's a good chance you are,

431
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,448
我们的所作所为会导致一个巨大的时间分支
anything we do can create a huge branch.

432
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,448
莫比乌斯 世界末日都让你搞得索然无味了
Oh, Mobius! You make even
the end of the world sound boring.

433
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,823
听着 好吧 我们就不该在这里
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.

434
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,532
-好吗？
-好吧
-Okay?
-Okay.

435
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,740
我们的动作可能会影响历史进程
Anything we do can impact
the course of history.

436
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,198
-你明白吗？
-明白 明白
-Do you get that?
-Yes. Yes.

437
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:52,573
所以咱们得从非常小的干扰开始
So we're gonna start
with very small disturbances.

438
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,500
-非常小的
-你会鸟叫吗？
-Very small.
-Can you make bird noises?

439
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,740
鸟叫？
Bird noises?

440
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,417
是啊 鸟叫 就是那种从嘴里吹气的声音
Yeah. Bird noises.
Like some, like, whooshing noises.

441
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,333
洛基 洛基
-Oh. Loki! Loki!

442
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,125
走吧！
-Go!

443
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,448
享受自由吧 头上长角的朋友 你们自由了
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

444
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,407
我叫洛基

445
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:19,657
我们是时间变异管理局的特工

446
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:23,365
我给你们带来了黑暗的消息

447
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,365
你们所有人！

448
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,323
都要葬身于此

449
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:35,958
那座火山即将喷发！

450
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:42,407
我能知道是因为我来自未来

451
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,032
我们是来自未来的 对吧？
We are
from the future, right?

452
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,198
时间变异管理局是什么？
我的意思是 它来自于未来
What is the TVA?
I mean, it's from the future.

453
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,583
听着就特别未来
真的很有未来感
It sounds from the future.
It's pretty future-y.

454
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:53,032
时间刚刚好！
-

455
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,532
享受你们的最后一餐吧
Enjoy your last meal while you can!

456
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,698
一切都不重要了！
Nothing matters!

457
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,865
不会有任何后果！
Nothing has any consequence!

458
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,240
趁着没死继续跳舞吧！
Dance while you still can!

459
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,833
-Whoo-hoo!
-

460
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,657
情况如何？
How'd we do?

461
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,865
难以置信 变异能量为零
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.

462
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,573
也没有产生时间分支
No branching in the timeline.

463
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:15,365
时间变异管理局根本不知道咱们在这里
The TVA would never
even know we were here.

464
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:19,250
如果是我的话 这就是我的藏身之处
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

465
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,782
是末日 时间犯偷袭我们的士兵
Doomsdays. The Variant's been
ambushing our soldiers

466
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,865
然后藏在末日里 隐匿行踪
and hiding out in doomsdays
to cover his tracks.

467
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,948
-不用谢
-好
-You're welcome.
-Yeah.

468
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,032
要让这个理论成立 灾难就应该是
For this theory to hold,
the disasters have to be

469
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:33,032
自然发生的 突如其来的 毫无征兆的 无人幸免的
naturally-occurring,
sudden, no warning, no survivors.

470
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,115
-有多少符合条件的？
-我不知道
-How many could there be?
-I don't know.

471
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,125
我们会知道的
We're gonna find out.

472
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,333
嘿？
Hey?

473
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,167
来吧 咱们一起走走
Come on, let's take a walk.

474
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:58,615
话说 你桌上的那本杂志
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

475
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,032
有摩托艇那本？
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

476
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,407
是的
Yes.

477
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,792
你要那个干什么？
Why do you have that?

478
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,292
因为它们棒极了
Because they're awesome.

479
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,240
-我知道
-是
I suppose they are.
-Yeah.

480
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,740
有些东西…其实历史上大多数东西都挺蠢的
You know, some things... Actually,
most things in history are kinda dumb,

481
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,490
而且最终一切都会湮灭
and everything gets ruined eventually.

482
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,323
但是在九十年代初期 有一段短暂的辉煌
But in the early 1990s,
for a brief, shining moment,

483
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:24,490
那是外形与功能的美丽统一
there was a beautiful union
of form and function,

484
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,323
那就是摩托艇
which we call the jet ski,

485
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,625
任何有理智的人都会感同身受
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

486
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,698
你骑过吗？
You ever been on one?

487
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:35,115
没有…没有
No... No.

488
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,073
如果时间变异管理局的特工
骑着摩托艇出现在神圣的时间线上
I think a TVA agent showing up
on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

489
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,115
一定会产生时间分支
that would create a branch for sure.

490
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,365
不过肯定很有趣
It'd be fun, though.

491
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,875
是的 绝对很有趣
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

492
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,583
所以 为什么看那些？
So, why read about them?

493
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:54,000
就是提醒我自己 我们是为什么而奋斗
Just helps remind me
of what we're fighting for.

494
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,865
我的意思是 你对这一切都深信不疑 对不对？
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?

495
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:02,073
我不会在 “相信或不相信” 这件事上纠结
I don't get hung up on,
"Believe, not believe."

496
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,282
我就是接受了这一切
I just accept what is.

497
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,323
-三只魔法蜥蜴
-是时间守护者
-Three magic lizards...
-Time-Keepers.

498
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,615
-创造了时间变异管理局和这里所有的人
-没错
-...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
-Right.

499
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,823
-也包括你？
-也包括我
-...including you?
-Including me.

500
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,948
每一次我想夸你聪明的时候
Every time I start
to admire your intelligence,

501
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:17,448
-你就开始说这种话
-好吧 是谁创造的你 洛基？
-you say something like that.
-Okay, who created you, Loki?

502
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,032
约顿海姆的冰霜巨人
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

503
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,448
那是谁养育的你呢？
And who raised you?

504
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,740
阿斯加德的奥丁
Odin of Asgard.

505
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,073
奥丁 天界之神
Odin, God of the Heavens.

506
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,365
阿斯加德 神秘的国度 远在星辰大海
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

507
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,990
-冰霜巨人 你自己听听…
-这不一样
-Frost Giants. Listen to yourself...
-It's not the same.

508
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,407
-这完全不一样啊
-不
-It's completely different.
-No.

509
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,907
-这不是一回事
-这就是一回事
-It's not the same.
-It's exactly the same thing.

510
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,698
因为如果深究我们从哪里来的问题
Because if you think too hard
about where any of us came from,

511
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,448
我们到底是什么的问题
听起来都有点荒谬
who we truly are,
it sounds kinda ridiculous.

512
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:41,365
存在即混乱
Existence is chaos.

513
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,532
没什么是有意义的 所以我们就试着寻找意义
Nothing makes any sense,
so we try to make some sense of it.

514
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:49,615
我很幸运 我出身的混乱赐予了我这一切…
And I'm just lucky that the chaos
I emerged into gave me all this...

515
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,583
我的光荣使命
-My own glorious purpose.
-

516
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,573
时间变异管理局就是我的生命
'Cause the TVA is my life.

517
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,708
它是真实的 因为我相信它是真实的
And it's real because I believe it's real.

518
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,407
行吧 你相信它是真实的
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

519
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:03,865
是的
Yeah.

520
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,657
所以一切都是注定的
So everything is written.

521
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,907
过去 现在 将来
Past, present, future.

522
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:09,782
根本就没有什么自由意志
There's no such thing as free will.

523
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,323
我觉得 这种说法过于简化了
Well, I mean, you know,
it's an oversimplification...

524
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,782
所以 事实上 可以这么说
So, in fact, in a way,

525
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:22,208
在时间变异管理局这里
你我是唯一真正自由的
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.

526
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,667
你到底想说什么 洛基？
Where are you going with this, Loki?

527
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,282
那这一切怎么结束？
How does it all end?

528
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,448
工作还没干完呢
That's a work in progress.

529
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:31,990
那些懒散的时间守护者
他们在等待什么？
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?

530
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,282
并非如此
Au contraire.

531
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,823
在我们保护过去的时候
No. Because while we protect
what came before,

532
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,490
他们正在室内伏案工作
they're toiling away in their chamber,

533
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,865
厘清无限分支中的终极结局
untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

534
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,240
我明白了 那当他们完成的时候
会发生什么？
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?

535
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,657
我们的工作也就完成了
So are we.

536
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,365
再也没有关连事件了
No more nexus events.

537
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,490
只有秩序
Just order.

538
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,125
然后我们在时间的尽头平静相见
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

539
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:57,708
是不是很棒？
Nice, right?

540
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,323
只有秩序？
-Only order?
-Mmm-hmm.

541
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,073
没有混乱吗？听起来很无聊
No chaos? It sounds boring.

542
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,865
你肯定觉得无聊
I'm sure it does to you.

543
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,740
你说我是被吓坏的小男孩
You called me a scared little boy.

544
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,282
我说你的可不止这个
I called you a lotta things.

545
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,458
的确如此
You did.

546
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,708
但是你错了
You're wrong, though.

547
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,323
你看 我比孩子知道得多
You see, I know something children don't.

548
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,323
知道什么呢？
What's that?

549
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,583
没有纯粹的坏人
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

550
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:24,167
也没有纯粹的好人
And no one good is ever truly good.

551
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,698
被吓坏的小男孩
Scared little boy.

552
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:32,782
是的 你这是自以为高人一等
我其实觉得挺过分的
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

553
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,958
没错

554
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,792
你可真聪明
You're very clever.

555
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,167
当然了
I know.

556
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:46,907
这个时间犯在犯罪现场留下了些东西
The Variant left something
behind at an old crime scene.

557
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,948
那是个大教堂
他留下了一个糖果盒
A cathedral. A candy box.

558
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,323
明显不符合那个时代
An obvious anachronism.

559
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,073
我交给分析部了
但是他们没发现什么
I gave it to Analysis,
but they couldn't find anything real.

560
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,740
-为什么要提起这个？
-因为这样我们就有两个变量了
-Why does that matter?
-'Cause now we have two variables.

561
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,833
末日 自然灾害 以及…
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

562
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,365
-卡布路易
-那是什么？
-Kablooie.
-LOKI: What's that?

563
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,865
是糖果 阿斯加德有糖果吗？
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

564
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,948
有啊 有葡萄和坚果
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

565
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,407
怪不得你那么苦大仇深的
No wonder you're so bitter.

566
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:14,907
好吧 卡布路易只有2047年到2051年间
在地球的个别地区发售过
Okay. Kablooie was only sold
regionally on Earth from 2047 to 2051.

567
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:18,073
我们需要对每一个末日事件进行交叉比对
We need to cross-reference
that with every apocalyptic event.

568
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,240
这一半你来
I'm gonna give you half.

569
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,907
咱们比比看谁先找到
Have a competition, see who finds it.

570
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:22,490
-没问题
-你想赌点什么吗？
-Sure.
-You wanna bet something?

571
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,948
-好啊
-来一场绅士的赌局
-Yeah.
-Gentleman's bet.

572
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,958
是的 赌上我们的骄傲
好的 用实力说话 开始
Yeah, let's play for pride.
Okay. May the best man win. Go.

573
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:30,073
发现什么了吗？
-Anything?
-Uh...

574
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,115
肯定不是2048年的气候灾难
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

575
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,740
也不是2051年的海啸
Or the tsunami of 2051.

576
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,782
赶紧 赶紧 加把劲
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

577
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,282
2050年
2050.

578
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,823
燕子灭绝了…那是什么？
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?

579
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,823
整个生态系统都完蛋了
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

580
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,282
喀拉喀托火山在2049年也爆发了
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

581
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,573
没发现卡布路易
No Kablooie.

582
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,157
天啊 坏事一件接一件 是不是？
God, it's just one damn thing
after another, isn't it?

583
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,333
-飓风、饥荒、火山爆发、洪水…
-找到了
-Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods...
-Got him.

584
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,448
末日事件报告

585
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,708
-他应该在这里
-阿拉巴马州 2050年
-That's where he is.
-MOBIUS: Alabama, 2050.

586
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,833
我得当心你以后会抢了我的饭碗
You're gonna take my job
if I'm not careful.

587
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,907
你想让我批准派出一支全副武装的小队…
You want me to approve deployment
of a fully-armed task force to...

588
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,032
-是的
-去时间犯可能的藏身处？
-Yeah.
-...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

589
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,907
阿拉巴马州黑文山
那是个自治市
Haven Hills, Alabama,
corporate town

590
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:14,282
属于罗克斯卡特 后来一场飓风将该市完全摧毁
owned by Roxxcart until
it's wiped out by a hurricane.

591
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,865
那里的食物和补给充足
All the food and supplies you need.

592
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,532
只要他愿意
If he likes it, there's no reason

593
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,407
他就没有理由不回去
他可以把那里反复当作据点
he can't keep going back
and just camping out, over and over.

594
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,698
而且这些理论都来自于
And this is all based
on a theory from the Variant

595
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,740
-那个上次搞砸任务的时间犯？
-是的 他干得不错
-who just blew your previous mission?
-Yeah, he's doing great.

596
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,490
莫比乌斯 作为你的朋友
Mobius, as your friend,

597
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,698
我必须得告诉你 相信这个人可不明智
I have to tell you that trusting
this man is not a good idea.

598
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,698
我知道 但是也许值得一试
No. I know.
But maybe he's worth the trouble.

599
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,740
他刚刚发现了咱们安保的巨大漏洞
He just uncovered
a huge hole in our security.

600
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,198
我担心的就是这个
That's what concerns me!

601
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,198
我能搞定他 相信我
I can handle him. Trust me.

602
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,823
我们要抓的人就在那里
This is where we get our guy.

603
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,490
我相信你 但是他
You, I trust, but him.

604
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,573
听着 拉沃娜
我的直觉告诉我
Listen, Ravonna,
every instinct is telling me

605
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,417
在那里肯定能抓到这个时间犯
this is where we nail the Variant.

606
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,407
批准吧 你从来没见我这么激动过 是不是？
Come on. You don't see me
usually this worked up, right?

607
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,073
我兴奋极了
I'm excited.

608
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:56,083
我都迫不及待了
I'm chomping at the bit.

609
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,615
-好吧
-太好了
-Okay.
-Yes. Okay.

610
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,833
-但是 莫比乌斯
-是的？
-But, Mobius?
-Yeah?

611
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,490
如果这次还是不行 我就帮不了你了
There's not much I can do
if it doesn't work out.

612
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,948
永恒
For all time.

613
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,490
常相伴
Always.

614
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,583
好的
Okay.

615
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,833
咱们出动
We're on.

616
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,532
咱们今天干得漂亮
We are doing some good work today.

617
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,740
我也这么觉得
I thought so too.

618
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,407
我跟你说 你要是真能帮我们抓住这个时间犯
I'm tellin' you.
You actually help us catch this Variant,

619
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,032
也许吧 我的朋友
and who knows, my friend.

620
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,823
怎么着 能让我和时间守护者见面吗？
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?

621
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,907
我可没那么说
I didn't say that.

622
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:37,407
-一步一步来吧
-好吧 一步一步来
-One step at a time.
-All right. One step at a time.

623
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:39,657
-以防万一
-太好了 这感觉让人…
-Just in case.
-Yeah, don't those feel...

624
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,208
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

625
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,490
集合 准备任务简报
Gather around for a briefing.

626
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,615
罗克斯卡特是个超大型超市
在那个时代很常见
Roxxcart is a vast superstore
common to the era.

627
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,407
整个建筑由许多分区组成
It consists of a series
of sprawling sections,

628
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:55,657
还有一个巨大的仓库
including a large warehouse.

629
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,907
这个仓库在飓风期间变成了民众的避难所
This warehouse is being used by civilians
as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

630
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,823
记住 这可是十级的末日事件
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

631
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,907
虽然时间犯不知道我们会出现
While the Variant
shouldn't know we're coming,

632
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,907
但是他可能藏在任何地方
并且很可能发动攻击
he could be hiding anywhere
and should be considered hostile.

633
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,490
请务必保持警惕
So stay alert.

634
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,698
这个时间犯每次袭击后
都会偷走重置器
Every time there is an attack,
the Variant steals a reset charge.

635
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,198
他肯定有所图谋
He's planning something.

636
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,615
只是我们还不知道
We just don't know what.

637
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,073
所以一定要留意那些重置器
So keep an eye out
for the missing charges,

638
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:23,667
如果你看到洛基 直接裁剪
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

639
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,167
注意 是那个坏的洛基
The bad Loki, preferably.

640
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:33,157
阿拉巴马州 黑文山

641
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:36,208
罗克斯卡特出品

642
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,115
2050年

643
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:54,750
罗克斯卡特

644
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,865
有情况吗？
Anything?

645
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:01,083
暂时没有 出发！
Nothing yet. Move out!

646
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,667
这是怎么回事？
The hell was that?

647
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,625
我在用魔法烘干衣服
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

648
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:32,375
我又不是你们
每走一步都得大喊大叫的
So I don't announce myself with every
squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

649
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,657
带上两支队伍去搜查风暴避难所
HUNTER B-15: Take both teams
and sweep the storm shelter.

650
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,365
-遵命 长官
-洛基和我一起
-Yes, ma'am.
-MOBIUS: Loki and I are gonna

651
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,198
去查看那个温室 咱们在那边…
check out the Green House. We'll meet...

652
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,323
-不行
-不行？
-No.
-No?

653
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,240
你和D-90一起行动 他得跟着我
You go with D-90. He stays with me.

654
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,365
你说什么…
我得全程监视着他
What are you...
He's under my supervision.

655
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,990
这次行动我说了算 莫比乌斯
This is my field op, Mobius.

656
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,615
-如果他不构成威胁 就没事…
-他当然构成威胁
-If he's not a threat, then...
-Of course he's a threat.

657
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,323
-你还记得时间剧场吗？
-莫比乌斯…
-Remember the Time Theater?
-Mobius...

658
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,907
-这就是为什么我需要他跟我一起
-你可以回时间变异管理局
-I want him with me.
-You are welcome to go back

659
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,323
找洛斯蕾尔去提意见 但是现在…
to the TVA and litigate
with Renslayer, but right now...

660
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,948
我们都到这里了 我们不会回去
We're here. We're not going back.

661
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:02,740
-时间犯就在这里
-莫比乌斯 没关系的
-The Variant is here.
-Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.

662
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,833
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

663
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:11,000
我明白 信任是需要争取的 我会努力的
I understand
I have to earn that, so, I will.

664
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:17,917
为什么那些根本不能信任的人
总是把“相信我”挂在嘴边上？
Why is it the people you can't trust
are always saying, "Trust me"?

665
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:20,907
好吧 这次得一直戴着时间项圈
Okay, try to hang on
to your Time Collar this time.

666
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,583
咱们在展厅见
We'll see you in the showroom.

667
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,032
很高兴能和你在一起
I am glad we're getting
to spend this time together.

668
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,115
安静
-Quiet.
-

669
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,833
我想说咱们是不是走错了…
-I'm saying we got off on the wrong...
-Shh.

670
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,157
嘿!
HUNTER B-15: Hey!

671
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,032
别激动
Whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

672
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,532
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

673
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,292
买绿植
Shopping for plants.

674
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,365
在这个暴风天？
In this storm?

675
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,865
暴风天有特价
It's a hurricane sale.

676
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,532
杜鹃花打五折
Azaleas are half off.

677
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,542
是你吗？
Could that be you?

678
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:39,250
我觉得 我可能会穿得更正式些
但是 没错 也许吧
I mean, I probably would have
worn a suit, but, yes, maybe.

679
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,698
他死了吗？
Is he dead?

680
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:58,292
没有 一般都能活下来
No. They usually survive.

681
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:08,667
所以你就是时间变异管理局找来
追捕我的那个笨蛋
So, you're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

682
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,698
应该是我吧
Me, I presume.

683
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:19,125
拜托 每个人都有身份 你就是我
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

684
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,865
见到你真开心
How nice to meet you.

685
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,990
过去的一小时里 风力在增强
NEWS ANCHOR: For the past hour
we have seen winds intensifying.

686
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,740
再说一遍 如果你刚看到
我们有两个...
-Again, if you're just tuning in...
-

687
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,032
检查一下包里有没有重置器
HUNTER D-90: Check the bags
for the reset charges.

688
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,907
你们是联邦应急管理署的吗？
You guys FEMA?

689
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,615
还是国民警卫队？
National Guard?

690
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:37,990
可能是他们中的任何人
Could be any one of them.

691
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,407
如果你们有直升飞机或者其它交通工具
Well, hey, if you got
a 'copter or other transport,

692
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,657
现在该派上用场了
now is the time to use it.

693
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,323
这里有女人和小孩
这天气可不是闹着玩的
We got women and kids,
and that weather ain't playin'.

694
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,907
抱歉 我们没有
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

695
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:50,750
那你们是怎么来的？
Well, how the heck did you get here?

696
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:53,740
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

697
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,833
你吓到他们了
Hey! These people are scared.

698
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,323
他们快要死了 他们本来就应该害怕
They're about to die.
They should be scared.

699
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,365
但不是害怕我们
Okay. Not of us.

700
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,375
-先生
-别着急
-Sir!
-Take it easy.

701
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,875
怎么了？
What is it?

702
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,865
这是真的 这是真的 这是真的
It's real. It's real. It's real.

703
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:16,750
这是真的 这是真的 这是真的
It's real. It's real. It's real.

704
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,407
附身这一招挺聪明
Enchantment is a clever trick.

705
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:25,865
有点懦弱 有点业余 但是挺聪明
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

706
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:30,115
和为时间变异管理局工作一样懦弱
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

707
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,282
我是为我自己工作的
I'm working for me.

708
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:35,500
-你还真信了 是不是？
-对
You really believe that,
don't you? Yeah.

709
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:39,032
我还担心他们找到了一个更高等的我呢
And here I was worried
that they'd found a better version of me.

710
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:41,282
你们是在找避难所吗？
Hi, are you guys looking
for the disaster shelter?

711
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:43,375
不是
No.

712
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,000
老天保佑
THE VARIANT: Oh, bless.

713
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:02,083
你要向你那些小朋友求救吗？
Are you going to call your little friends
for help?

714
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,323
怎么了？
LOKI: What's the matter?

715
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,792
你害怕和我面对面吗？
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?

716
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,875
现身吧
Show yourself.

717
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,417
得到他们的信任可不容易
You know, gaining their confidence
was no mean feat.

718
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,667
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

719
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,250
你是在卧底
You went undercover.

720
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:36,573
如果你稍微收敛一下
If you could possibly sheathe
your smarm for a moment,

721
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,708
我就告诉你我来找你的原因
I have an offer for you.
That's why I found you.

722
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,125
继续说
Go on.

723
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,500
我要推翻时间守护者
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

724
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:51,573
我跟你摊牌
And, uh, cards on the table,

725
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,750
我需要一个合格的副官
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

726
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,948
我猜你说的是…我？
And I assume you mean... Me?

727
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,292
你觉得呢
What say you...

728
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:05,042
洛基？
Loki?

729
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,667
别那么叫我
Ugh. Don't call me that.

730
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,167
你可以叫我
You can call me...

731
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
兰迪
Randy.

732
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,948
天啊 我算明白为什么索尔
觉得这很烦了
God. Now I understand
why Thor found this so annoying.

733
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:18,698
别耍我了 我可是在帮你
Enough with your games.
I've been trying to help you.

734
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:21,490
在文艺复兴市集上
我可是帮你拖延了不少时间
I kept them vulnerable
at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

735
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,573
天啊 太感谢你了
Oh, gosh,
and that was just so nice of you.

736
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:28,115
但是考虑了八到十秒以后
But after eight to ten seconds
of consideration,

737
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,583
我的答案是否定的
the answer is no.

738
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:34,917
我对统治时间变异管理局毫无兴趣
I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

739
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,073
这是真的 这是真的
HUNTER C-20: It's real. It's real.

740
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,198
这是真的 这是真的
It was real. It was real.

741
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,907
-什么是真的？什么...
-这是真的
-What's real? What's...
-It's real.

742
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,615
-她疯了
-这是真的
-She's off the dial.
-It's real.

743
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,532
-看着我
-这是真的
-MOBIUS: Look at me.
-It's real.

744
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:51,198
我想回家
I wanna go home.

745
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,573
我们会带你回家
We're gonna get you there.

746
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,365
呼叫时间变异管理局 通知医务室
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

747
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,333
不不不 我说出去了
No, no, no. I gave it away.

748
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,657
-我说出去了
-你说出去什么了？
-I gave it away.
-What did you give away...

749
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:03,500
时间守护者 他们的位置
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

750
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:07,083
我把找到他们的方法说出去了
I gave it away how to find them.

751
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,250
B-15 你那边情况如何？
B-15, what is your status?

752
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:15,375
B-15 请回话 你那边什么情况？
B-15, come in. What's your status?

753
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,333
B-15 你能听到吗？
B-15, do you copy?

754
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,823
如果你不想统治时间变异管理局
那你想干什么？
If you don't wanna rule the TVA,
then what do you want?

755
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,615
这不重要 你来得太晚了
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

756
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,740
你会发现我永远是抢占先机的
I think you'll find
I'm well ahead of schedule.

757
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,573
我就是这样找到你的藏身之处的
I found your hiding place like that.

758
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:46,333
我觉得我才是更高等的洛基 你说呢？
I'd say that makes me
the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

759
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,115
我明白了 那是你的计划
I see. That's your plan.

760
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:54,333
把我们引到这里
然后炸掉这个地方
Lure us all here
so you can blow the place up.

761
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,458
-

762
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,573
我想念兰迪
I miss Randy.

763

-

764
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,157
谢谢你帮我拖延时间
Thank you for helping me stall for time.

765
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:15,333
你真的很喜欢自说自话
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

766
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:18,083
以前还没人跟我这么说过
You're the first person
to tell me that.

767
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,365
我永远也不会这样对待自己
I would never treat me like this.

768
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,375
你好
Hi.

769
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:38,500
来吧 别藏着了
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.

770
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:55,115
洛基 你要是还要脸
就自己来和我打
Loki, if you had any honor
you'd fight me as yourself.

771
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,573
我忙着呢
I have shit to do.

772
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,958
够了

773
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,958
-

774
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,448
-莫比乌斯
-他在哪？
-HUNTER B-15: Mobius.
-Where is he?

775
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,240
-我跟丢了
-发生了什么？
-I lost him.
-What happened?

776
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,365
我...
I...

777
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,323
看来你心爱的洛基背叛了你
Looks like your favorite
Loki betrayed you.

778
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,417
快点行动
MOBIUS: Just move!

779
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,948
你想从我这得到什么？
What do you want from me?

780
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,250
这是怎么回事？
What is this about?

781
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,625
做好心理准备吧 洛基
THE VARIANT: Brace yourself, Loki.

782
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,792

没错
Right.

795
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:28,208

Where they going?

798
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,792
