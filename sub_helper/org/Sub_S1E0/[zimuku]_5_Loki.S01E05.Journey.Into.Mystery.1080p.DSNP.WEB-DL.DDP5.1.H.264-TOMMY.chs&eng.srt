1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,740
-相信这个人可不明智 我能搞定他
-Trusting this man is not a good idea. I can handle him.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,990
时间变异管理局已经裁剪过这家伙很多次了 他们各不相同
The TVA has pruned a lotta these guys, and no two are alike.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,156
你们都是时间犯
LOKI: You're all Variants!

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:14,541
时间守护者并没有创造你们 他们把你们从时间线上绑架了
The Time-Keepers didn't create you. They kidnapped you from the timeline.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,583
前情提要

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,448
你们两个造成的关连事件
MOBIUS: The nexus event you caused,

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,406
不管是什么关系 会让这个地方崩溃
whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.

8
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,656
好吧 你想知道真相吗？
RENSLAYER: Fine. You want the truth?

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,156
我在试着保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

10
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,656
像我们这样的友谊并不常见
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

11
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,656
你知道让我选 我想去哪里吗？
You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere?

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,698
从哪里来我就该回哪里去
Wherever it is I'm really from.

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,031
对 在时间变异管理局之前我生活的地方
Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.

14
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,125
裁剪掉他
-Prune him.

15
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,865
时间守护者夺走了你们的人生
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

16
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,615
你们都是时间犯
You're Variants.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,625
咱们是一样的
We're the same.

18
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,698
没有灵魂的机器人
SYLVIE: Mindless androids.

19
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,448
那是谁创造了时间变异管理局？
LOKI: Then who created the TVA?

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,958
希尔维 我有话要对你说
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

21
00:00:55,833 --> 00:01:00,250
把你知道的一切都告诉我
You're gonna tell me everything.

22
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:42,500
漫威影业

23
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,323
这是什么地方？我们在哪？你们是谁？
LOKI: What is this place? Where are we? Who are you?

24
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,416
这里是虚空 那是艾利奥斯 而我们是它的午餐 赶紧吧
This is The Void. That's Alioth. And we're his lunch. Come on!

25
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,666
洛基

26
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,958
把你的时间控制器给我
Give me your TemPad.

27
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,990
-时间变异管理局背后是谁在操控？ 我也不知道
-Who's really behind the TVA? I'm as in the dark as you are.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,365
可悲的洛斯蕾尔法官 你所认定的现实都被颠覆了
Poor Judge Renslayer. Your whole reality's been destroyed.

29
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:10,833
跟我说说 知道真相的感觉如何？
Tell me, how does it feel to be on the other side of it?

30
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,875
也就这样了 是不是？
This is it, isn't it?

31
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,291
这就是你在窃取我人生后 带我来的地方
This is where you dragged me after you stole my life.

32
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:26,541
-也会是你人生被夺走最合适的地方 要是我说洛基还没死呢？
-A fitting place, then, to take yours. And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?

33
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,698
至少应该还没有
Not yet, anyway.

34
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,240
-你在说谎 也许吧
-I'd say you were lying. Maybe.

35
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,740
-也许咱们想要的东西是一样的 他怎么可能还活着？
-Or maybe we want the same thing. How is he still alive?

36
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,323
以及我们能通过救他来接近 时间变异管理局背后的主使吗？
And how will saving him get us closer to who's really behind the TVA?

37
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,156
这事比较复杂
It's complicated.

38
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,448
-告诉你这些我心甘情愿 为什么？
-I'm telling you this willingly. Why?

39
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,448
因为我想知道谁在掌控这一切
Because I wanna know who's at the top of this.

40
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,625
我想知道谁欺骗了我
I want to know who lied to me.

41
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,198
当我们裁剪一个分支现实的时候
When we prune a branched reality,

42
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,656
我们不可能毁灭掉所有的一切
it's impossible to destroy all of its matter.

43
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:58,031
所以我们把它移动到时间线上的某个地方 让它停止发展
So we move it to a place on the timeline where it won't continue growing.

44
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,740
基本上来说 时间线分支并没有重置
Basically, the branched timeline isn't reset.

45
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,823
-而是被转移了 转移去了哪里？
-It's transferred. To where?

46
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,198
时间尽头的虚空
A void at the end of time.

47
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,823
在那里 所有的存在互相碰撞
Where every instance of existence collides at the same point

48
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,740
然后停止发展
and simply stops.

49
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
为什么？
Why?

50
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,031
我也不知道
I don't know.

51
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,823
规则里面说 时间的尽头仍然在书写中
The dogma states that the end of time is still being written,

52
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,906
时间守护者会把它变成乌托邦
that the Time-Keepers are transforming it into utopia.

53
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,615
说得好听 真是唬人啊
That's nice. Super believable.

54
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,083
不管真实原因是什么…
Whatever the real reason. . .

55
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,833
从来没有什么能从那里回来
nothing ever comes back from there.

56
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,333
如果你相信我 我能帮你
I can help you if you trust me.

57
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,823
我建议咱们歇一下 我有无数个问题想问
I suggest we take a breather, so I can ask several thousand questions.

58
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,823
-不想死就赶紧走 好吧 但是你的计划是什么？
-Gotta keep moving so we don't die. Okay, but what's your plan?

59
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,615
-别死 好吧 还有呢？
-Don't die. Okay, but beyond that?

60
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,323
-别死 这算不上计划
-Don't die. That's not a plan.

61
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:13,250
这只是求生欲 作为洛基 就应该永远有计划…
It's a general demand of living. If you're Lokis, you should always have. . .

62
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,791
有没有谁能给我解释一下 到底是怎么回事？
Will someone please explain to me what the hell is going on?

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,948
过去的几天里 我一直非常非常地努力
Look, it's been a very, very, very trying past few days.

64
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,823
或许是几个月？我都不知道 自从纽约事件后到底过了多久
Months? I don't even know how long it's been since New York.

65
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,073
我只知道我被裁剪了 醒来就在这里了
All I know is, I got pruned and I woke up here,

66
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,573
还有一群跟我身份一样的时间犯围着我 以及一只短吻鳄
and now I'm surrounded by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,

67
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,365
可悲的是我都不觉得奇怪
which sadly I didn't find all that strange.

68
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,115
现在我们既不知道在逃避什么鬼 也不知道该往什么鬼地方逃
And now we're running from God knows what to God knows where.

69
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,375
而我需要想办法回到时间变异管理局去
When I need to be trying to find a way back to the TVA.

70
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,708
别叫唤了 你会引来艾里奥斯的
Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

71
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,958
你说那个天上的怪物？
You mean the monster in the sky?

72
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,781
谢谢
Thank you.

73
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,948
这里是时间变异管理局的垃圾场
This is the place where the TVA dumps its rubbish,

74
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,031
所有被裁剪的东西都在这里
everything they prune.

75
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,333
然后艾里奥斯
And Alioth,

76
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,240
确保这些东西有来无回
he ensures none of it ever returns.

77
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,240
它是个有生命的风暴 吞噬物质和能量
BOASTFUL LOKI: It's a living tempest that consumes matter and energy.

78
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,948
他们把所有分支现实扔到这 然后被立刻吞噬…
They send entire branched realities here that are devoured instant--

79
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,833
我们就像在鲨鱼缸里 艾里奥斯就是鲨鱼
We're in a shark tank. Alioth is the shark.

80
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,656
并没有什么鳄鱼缸
Oh, there's no such thing as an alligator tank.

81
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,990
而且这就是个比喻而已 他跟我们其他人一样 太敏感了
Besides, it's a better metaphor. He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,198
等等
Hang on,

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,541
-那玩意也是洛基？ 是啊
-that thing's a Loki too? Oh, yes.

84
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,823
好吧 没什么不能接受的 为什么有这么多个你们？
Okay, fine. Willing to accept that. Why are there so many of you?

85
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,948
因为洛基总能活下来 这可是咱们的强项
Because Lokis survive. That's just what we do.

86
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,823
-太棒了 那咱们怎么逃出去？ 我们逃不出去
-Great. So how do we escape? We don't.

87
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,656
我们都是被时间变异管理局逮捕 然后裁剪掉的 和你一样
All of us were arrested by the TVA and pruned, just like you.

88
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,323
而且我们都在制定各种无谓的计划 也和你一样
And just like you, we all stood around making bad plans that went nowhere.

89
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,740
咱们可以使用时间控制器啊
But we could use a TemPad.

90
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,240
逃跑的救命稻草 没错
Oh, the one thing that could get us out of here, yes.

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,375
应该到处都有吧 是不是？
They're all over the place, right, guys?

92
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,406
好吧 那如果制造出一个关连事件呢？
Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

93
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,615
时间变异管理局根本不在乎这里发生了什么
The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

94
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,448
-总能做点什么吧 有
-Surely there's something to do. There is.

95
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,031
活下去 这是唯一的办法 从过去到现在都一样
Survive. That's all there is. All there ever was.

96
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,781
话说完了 咱们走吧
KID LOKI: We're done talking. Let's go.

97
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,083
你想怎样随便吧
Just do what you want.

98
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,625
好吧 等等 等等
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,948
你为什么戴着角？你对那个小孩言听计从
Why do you wear the horns? You let a child command you.

100
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,958
你可得尊重那个孩子
You'll do well to respect the boy.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,490
-这是他的王国 对
-This is his kingdom. LOKI: Right.

102
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,490
你的关连事件是什么 国王陛下？
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

103
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,708
我杀了索尔
I killed Thor.

104
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,791
话说回来 你为什么这么急着 回时间变异管理局？
So, why did you want to return to the TVA so badly, anyway?

105
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,333
你把光荣的使命留在那里了？
You leave your glorious purpose there?

106
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,666
差不多吧
Something like that.

107
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,031
时间小姐 我需要远程接入
RENSLAYER: Miss Minutes, I need you to remote access

108
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,490
存档中的一些机密文件
a series of restricted files from the archives.

109
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,573
天啊 关于什么的？
MISS MINUTES: Ooh, doggy! On what?

110
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,240
时间的起始 时间变异管理局的建立
RENSLAYER: The beginning of time. The founding of the TVA.

111
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,708
-马上 等等
-MISS MINUTES: Right away. Wait.

112
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,531
-看看时间的尽头怎么样？ 那就是虚空而已
-What about the end of time? It's just a void.

113
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,791
如果虚空不是尽头呢？ 如果还有虚空以外的东西呢？
What if The Void isn't the end? What if there's something beyond it?

114
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,781
我就是躲在末日的阴影下 才逃离了时间变异管理局的视线
Hiding in the shadow of apocalypses obscured me from the TVA

115
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,708
因为我在那里不能创造分支 对不对？
because I couldn't create a diverging branch there, right?

116
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,406
所以如果这些都仍然在书写中 发生的任何事都会是一条新的时间线
So if all of this is still being written, whatever happens is just a new timeline.

117
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,823
在那里不可能出现关连事件
It would be impossible to start a nexus event there.

118
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,906
-你可能完全无法被发现 就是这样
-You could be completely undetectable. That's it.

119
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,458
-那是他们唯一能去的地方 那我们怎么穿越虚空呢？
-That's the only place they could be. So how do we get past The Void?

120
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,490
这是不可能的
It's impossible.

121
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,656
时间控制器无法定位 没有目的地
There's nothing for the TemPad to lock onto, no destination.

122
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
那我们就穿过它看看
Then we go through it.

123
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,823
-这是自杀 那我觉得留着你也没什么用了
-That's suicide. Then I guess my need for you has passed.

124
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,531
等等 试试虚空飞船怎么样？
Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

125
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,656
对 那个原型机
Yes, the prototype.

126
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,708
太好了 我来找文件
Great. I'll get the file.

127
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,531
那艘飞船是用来应对现世虚空的
It's a spaceship designed to withstand the temporal void.

128
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,656
它能把我们带到时间的尽头
It could take us to the end of time.

129
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,823
-找到洛基 找到幕后的主使
-Find Loki. Find the man behind the curtain.

130
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,416
-然后杀了他 齐心协力
-And kill him. Together.

131
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,906
时间小姐 这艘时间飞船的文件在哪里？
Miss Minutes, where are the files on this timecraft?

132
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,375
正在搜索 亲爱的
MISS MINUTES: Still lookin', hon.

133
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,031
还没找到吗？
Nothing?

134
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,031
它埋藏得很深
Hmm. Buried pretty deep.

135
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,948
那是高度机密 我可能都没有权限
It's highly restricted. I might not even have clearance.

136
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,083
不 我觉得你有 如果它真实存在的话
Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

137
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,615
还要多久？
How long?

138
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,031
随时都有可能
Any second now.

139
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,500
上啊 快点
GUARD: Go! Go! Go! Move it!

140
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,740
-你受伤了吗？ 我没事 但是她拿了我的时间控制器
-You hurt? I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.

141
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,656
希尔维？你不会还想逃跑吧？
Sylvie? Not thinking of going on the run, are you?

142
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,000
我们知道你藏在哪
We know where you hide.

143
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,000
我们早晚会抓住你
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.

144
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,000
你肯定已经筋疲力尽了
It must be so exhausting.

145
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,208
我承认刚才有那么一瞬间 我相信了你
I'll admit you had me fooled there for a minute.

146
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,865
也有可能你说的是真心话
Or did you get a little real?

147
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,906
洛斯蕾尔法官真的觉得 被她心爱的时间变异管理局背叛了吗？
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed by her beloved TVA?

148
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,990
要不然你出来 咱们好好聊聊？
Why don't you come back out and we can talk about it?

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,781
没问题 让其他人退下 咱们自己解决
Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off and we can settle this between us.

150
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,281
我接受
Works for me.

151
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,531
你不是还说要去抓幕后主使吗？
What happened to finding the man behind the curtain?

152
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,365
我告诉你 举起双手出来
Tell you what. You come out with your hands up

153
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,073
我就把你放到时间循环里
and I'll put you in a time loop.

154
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,490
也让你少受点罪
Something not so bad.

155
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,750
你可以不断重温那些美好的回忆
You can live out your days in a good memory.

156
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,875
你有美好的回忆吗？
Do you have any good memories?

157
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,333
其实只有一个
Just one, really.

158
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,541
-她自我裁剪了 很好
-She self-pruned. Good.

159
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,166
那她也就完蛋了
Then she's dead, too.

160
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,000
洛克西酒 上等黑皮诺

161
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:03,198
在我征服了美国队长和钢铁侠以后
So, after I vanquished Captain America and Iron Man,

162
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:08,041
我拿到了我的奖赏 全部六颗无限原石
I claimed my prize, all six Infinity Stones.

163
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,031
那只短吻鳄在咆哮着说 〝骗子〞
That's alligator for growling and saying "liar" at the same time.

164
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:18,458
至少我的关连事件不是吃错了邻居的猫
At least my nexus event wasn't eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

165
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,156
-讲讲你的故事 洛基 我的？
-Tell them your story, Loki. Me?

167
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,365
不会有人想听的
Nobody wants to hear about that.

168
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,125
其实我还挺想听的
I would, actually.

169
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:44,041
我就一直在想 因为我…
Um. . . It's just I've been wondering, because I'm. . .

170
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,781
我们本来该死掉的 是不是？
Well, we're supposed to die, right?

171
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,281
灭霸在诸神的黄昏后杀了我们
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

172
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,333
灭霸？
Thanos?

173
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,125
在我的时间线里
In my timeline,

174
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,240
一切都进行得很正常 我的一生都很正常
everything proceeded correctly, my entire life,

175
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,531
直到灭霸袭击了我们的飞船
until Thanos attacked our ship.

176
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,281
你没试着去刺杀他吗？
So, you didn't try to stab him?

177
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,823
当然没有
Certainly not.

178
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,698
我无意冒犯 朋友
Take no offense, my friends,

179
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,281
但是在洛基的法术面前 兵刃一文不值
but blades are worthless in the face of a Loki sorcery.

180
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,948
它们会阻碍我们的魔法潜力
They stunt our magical potential.

181
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,531
-但是它们看上去很厉害 是的
-But they look awesome. CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yes.

182
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:21,865
特别是当你被掐住脖子 它们掉在地上的时候
Especially when they clatter to the ground just before your neck is snapped.

183
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:28,365
我制造了一个非常逼真的自己的投影 连灭霸都被骗过了
I cast a projection of myself so real, even the Mad Titan believed it.

184
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,198
然后我在一堆尸体里装死
Then hid as inanimate debris.

185
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,208
伪造了死亡以后 我就在宇宙中游荡
After I faked my death, I simply drifted in space.

186
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,115
远离索尔 远离一切
Away from Thor, away from everything.

187
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,573
我思考关于宇宙的一切 思考我应在的位置
Thought about the universe and my place in it,

188
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,365
然后我突然明白了 我所到之处
and it occurred to me that everywhere I went,

189
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,406
只会带去痛苦
only pain followed.

190
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,573
所以我就把自己从等式里抹掉了
So I removed myself from the equation,

191
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:54,490
我在一个偏远的星球落脚 独自一人 离群索居
landed on a remote planet and stayed there in isolation, in solitude

192
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,750
这样过了很久很久
for a long, long time.

193
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,031
时间变异管理局怎么找到你的？
How did the TVA find you?

194
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,041
我有点寂寞了
I got lonely.

195
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,865
说老实话 我想我哥哥了
To tell you the truth, I missed my brother,

196
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,698
我在想 他会不会在思念我 有没有人会思念我
and I wondered if he missed me, if anybody else did.

197
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,906
但就在我刚刚要离开那颗星球的时候
But as soon as I took my first steps to getting off the planet,

198
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,073
时间变异管理局就来了
the TVA arrived.

199
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,573
因为 亲爱的朋友 咱们只能扮演一个角色
Because we, my friends, have but one part to play,

200
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,208
流放之神
the God of Outcasts.

201
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,041
除此之外没有了
Nothing more.

202
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,750
流放之神
The God of Outcasts.

203
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,490
-我要走了 去哪？
-I'm going. Going where?

204
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,990
从这里出去 从虚空出去 回到时间变异管理局去
Out of this place, out of The Void, back to the TVA.

205
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,281
咱们既擅长生存 又擅长逃跑
We're as good at escaping as we are at surviving.

206
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,073
所以咱们机会很大
That gives me a decent chance.

207
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,115
-你哪个也干不好 你会被干掉的 那我也认了
-You won't do either, you'll be murdered. Well, so be it.

208
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,781
-那就是我本来的宿命 你与众不同
-That was my destiny to begin with. You're different.

209
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,906
-为什么？ 我没什么不一样的 你明白吗？
-Why? No, I'm not, you see?

210
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,740
我和你们一样 真的 我和你们所有人都一样
I'm the same, really. I'm the same as all of you.

211
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,656
你们有谁遇到过女性的时间犯吗？
Have any of you met a woman Variant of us?

212
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,906
-听上去很可怕 她确实挺可怕
-Sounds terrifying. Oh, she is.

213
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,115
但这就是她吸引人的地方
But that's kind of what's great about her.

214
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,490
她才是与众不同的
She's different.

215
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,948
她不是企图接管时间变异管理局 而是要推翻它
She's not trying to take over the TVA, she's trying to take it down.

216
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,906
她需要我
And she needs me.

217
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,250
你说因为艾里奥斯 咱们只能困在这
Now, you said Alioth is what keeps us here.

218
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,281
你说它是有生命的 你说它是条鲨鱼
You said it's a living thing. You said it's a shark.

219
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:30,031
那么如果它有生命 它就会死亡
Well, if it lives, it dies.

220
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,698
所以我要去杀了那条鲨鱼
So I'm gonna kill the shark.

221
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:36,500
我要杀了艾里奥斯 我需要你们的帮助
I'm gonna kill Alioth, and I could use all the help I can get.

222
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,333
太棒了 宝贝 太搞笑了
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

223
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,333
-一群怪物 太搞笑了
-Monsters. CLASSIC LOKI: Oh, yeah.

224
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,708
你好 你是我们中的哪一个？
Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?

225
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,708
这简直是噩梦
This is a nightmare.

226
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,073
是你
SYLVIE: You.

227
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,490
把门关上 咱们还没脱险呢
Shut the door, we still got a situation here.

228
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,750
就这么随便上陌生人的车 你可得小心点
You should be careful just jumping into a stranger's car like that.

229
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,573
-当心 我看见了 我看见了
-Watch out! I see it, I see it.

230
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,406
-真的吗？你直接就撞过去了 天啊 你真的和你们一模一样
-Really? You're driving right towards it. God, you really are one of you.

231
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,416
等等
Hang on.

232
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,865
洛基 竞选总统

233
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,531
你这个混蛋 你这是引狼入室
You bastard! You led the wolves to our door.

234
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,906
我们认为蛇比狼更贴切
We prefer snakes to wolves.

235
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,906
这些我都干掉过 它们的死法没什么区别
I've eaten both. They die just the same.

236
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,781
抱歉 我的陛下
Apologies, my liege.

237
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:23,375
我背叛了你 现在我是国王了
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

238
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,740
说到这件事吧…
About that. . .

239
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,656
-你不是认真的吧 拜托
-You can't be serious. Come on.

240
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,031
-你想要什么？ 我不是在讨价还价
-What did you expect? That was not the bargain!

241
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,406
我给你提供了我们的位置 你得给我们庇护和供给
I gave you our location. In exchange for shelter and supplies,

242
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,740
给我你的军队 我去夺取王位
you give me your army and I take the throne.

243
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,031
好吧
PRESIDENT LOKI: Ah, yes.

244
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,281
这交易不怎么样
Not so good a bargain.

245
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:44,115
那这个怎么样？ 军队是我的 王位也是我的
How about this one? My army, my throne?

246
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,416
说到这件事吧
About that.

247
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,781
你们这些愚蠢的下贱东西 为什么要这么做？
Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.

248
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,833
-咱们说好的 看在老天的份上
-We had a deal! For God's sake.

249
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,990
这里为什么会有只短吻鳄？
Why the hell is there an alligator in here?

250
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,250
他是个洛基
ALL: He's a Loki!

251
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,833
为了光荣的使命
BOASTFUL LOKI: Glorious purpose!

252
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,166
来这边
Come on.

253
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,583
进来 洛基
Take that, Loki!

254
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,448
该死 一群禽兽！
Damn it! Animals, animals!

255
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,823
我们撒谎 我们欺骗
We lie and we cheat,

256
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,990
我们杀害了每个相信我们的人 为的是什么？
we cut the throat of every person who trusts us, and for what?

257
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,291
权力 光荣的权力 光荣的使命
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!

258
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,365
我们不能改变
We cannot change.

259
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,823
我们就是坏蛋 每个版本都是 永远如此
We're broken, every version of us. Forever.

260
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,573
无论什么时候 如果有哪个 企图改邪归正
And whenever one of us dares try to fix themselves,

261
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,240
他们就会被送到这来送死
they're sent here to die.

262
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,490
这就是我为什么得从这出去
That's why I need to get out of here.

263
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,990
除非时间变异管理局被干掉 否则什么也改变不了
Nothing can change until the TVA is stopped.

264
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,698
-你相信她吗？ 她是我唯一相信的人
-And you trust her? She's the only one I do trust.

265
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,781
而此时此刻 我认为她是我们 干掉时间变异管理局唯一的机会
And right now, I believe she's our only chance of stopping the TVA.

266
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,208
这对我就够了
That's good enough for me.

267
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:39,041
好吧 好吧 我们帮你
Okay, okay. We'll help you.

268
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,541
但是接近艾里奥斯就是送死
But approaching Alioth is a death sentence.

269
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,958
我们会帮你接近它 但是也就到此为止了
We'll get you to it, but that's as far as we go.

270
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,115
一直以来 我真的认为我们都是好人
All that time, I really believed we were the good guys.

271
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,656
消除所有的现实 让小女孩无父无母
Annihilating entire realities, orphaning little girls,

272
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,656
真是经典的英雄事迹
classic hero stuff.

273
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,490
我想 如果为了结果可以不择手段
Well, I guess when you think the ends justify the means,

274
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,115
就没有什么是你不能做的了
there's not much you won't do.

275
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,656
而且你也没少消除东西
By the way, you did some annihilating too.

276
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,656
-我那是迫不得已 没错 我也是
-I did what I had to do. Yeah, so did I.

277
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,333
你像只猎狗一样追杀我
You hunted me like a dog.

278
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,541
我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that.

279
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,333
当我裁剪自己的时候 我觉得也许能找到洛基
When I pruned myself, I thought I might be able to find Loki.

280
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,781
那个风暴 那个东西 可能已经抓住他了
That storm, that thing, it's likely already got him.

281
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,281
你真的这么认为吗？
You really believe that?

282
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

283
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,323
现在唯一重要的事就是从这出去
The only thing that matters now is getting out of here

284
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,490
然后找到幕后的主使
and finding out who's behind all of this.

285
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,031
好 我们该怎么做？
Great. How do we do that?

286
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,208
我们需要掉头
We turn around.

287
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,823
掉头？回去找那团愤怒的乌云？
Turn around? What, and go back to the angry cloud?

288
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,365
对 我觉得那就是答案所在
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

289
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,750
我们要回去找它
We're going back to it.

290
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:13,698
我必须得说 和那团庞然大物面对面 感觉有点糟糕
CLASSIC LOKI: I have to say, it feels odd walking toward the gargantuan creature.

291
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,448
你有行动的计划吗？
Do you have a plan of action?

292
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,406
冲进去 找到它的心脏或者大脑什么的
Get inside, find its heart or brain or whatever,

293
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,490
-然后 你知道的 动手 我的意思是…
-and then, you know, do it in. KID LOKI: I mean. . .

294
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,375
计划简单 不代表计划不行
Just because it's not complicated doesn't mean it's bad.

295
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,166
也不代表它就可行
It also doesn't mean it's good.

296
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,906
看 他表示赞同
See? He's on board.

297
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:35,041
他那是在祈祷 他觉得我们都要死了
He's praying. He thinks we're going to die.

298
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,500
所有人准备战斗
SAILOR: All hands to battle stations!

299
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,698
艾里奥斯和其它动物一样
Alioth is like any animal.

300
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,750
他会先去追逐那些大型的猎物
He'll go after the big meal first.

301
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,625
在它忙于那些的时候 我们就可以潜到它背后 然后…
And while he's busy with that, we can sneak around the back and. . .

302
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,916
开火
Fire!

303
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,156
好吧
Okay.

304
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
也许我们…
Maybe we, uh. . .

305
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,416
应该再好好想想 是不是？
think a bit more about this, huh?

306
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,448
有辆车
Car.

307
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,198
-什么？ 在那边
-What? Along the horizon.

308
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,281
是坏事吗？
LOKI: Is that bad?

309
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,906
一般都是食人族的强盗
KID LOKI: Well, usually means cannibalistic marauders

310
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,490
或者是食人族的海盗
or cannibalistic pirates.

311
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,750
真不错
Delightful.

312
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,031
他们在放慢速度
Now they're slowing down.

313
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,291
-他们在干什么？ 保持警惕
-What are they doing? Just stay on guard.

314
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
希尔维
Sylvie.

315
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,115
我不理解 他到底是懦弱还是勇敢
I don't understand. Is he a coward or was he being brave?

316
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,125
-我也不太确定 来吧
-I'm not too sure. Come on.

317
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,240
你还活着
You're alive.

318
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,916
发生什么了？你还好吗？
What happened? You okay?

319
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,333
莫比乌斯
Mobius!

320
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:20,458
-你们怎么… 我们觉得你可能需要援助
-How did you. . . We thought you could do with some backup.

321
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,490
不 等等 等等 这些是我的朋友
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, these are my friends.

322
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,115
好吧 他们是…我该怎么说好呢？
Well, they're, um. . . How best to put this?

323
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,365
这是咱们的孩子版 这是咱们的未来版
Us as a child, us in the future,

324
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:38,000
这是咱们的短吻鳄版
and us as an alligator.

325
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,573
最好别去挑战它
It's best not to question it.

326
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,698
在这随便扔块石头 砸到的都是洛基
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

327
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,906
所以你也在追逐那个巨大的乌云怪物？
So you're all after the giant cloud monster, too, then?

328
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,865
我们还没决定怎么杀掉它 但是…
Well, we haven't decided how we're going to kill it, but. . .

329
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,740
-再说一遍？杀掉它？ 对 我们要杀掉艾里奥斯
-Come again? Kill it? Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

330
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,448
天啊 那是你的计划
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

331
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,281
-对 然后你们就这么接受了？
-Yeah. And you went along with it?

332
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,073
-我有我的疑虑 可能不太安全
-KID LOKI: I had my doubts. Probably unsafe.

333
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,490
好吧 那你的计划是什么？
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

334
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,698
我觉得我们要寻找的人 就在虚空之外时间的尽头
I think the person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time.

335
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,781
如果他们真的在那
And if they are,

336
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,198
这个东西就是守卫着唯一入口的看门狗
that thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.

337
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,448
好吧 那我们怎么绕过这只看门狗？
Okay, so, um, how do we get past the guard dog?

338
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,458
我要附身在它身上
I'm gonna enchant it.

339
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,281
-那太疯狂了吧？ 那还要怎么样？
-That's insane, right? As insane as what?

340
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,156
-一刀一刀把乌云砍死？ 听着
-Paper-cutting a cloud to death? Listen,

341
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,583
-我来这时间比你长 我要附身在它身上
-I've been down here longer than you. . . I'm going to enchant it.

342
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,833
她很自信
She's pretty confident.

343
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,458
你们出去吧
Leave us.

344
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,666
为什么把我关在这里？
Why am I locked in here?

345
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,531
你放走了那个时间犯
You freed the Variant.

346
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,948
-你背叛了时间变异管理局 背叛？
-You were disloyal to the TVA. Disloyal?

347
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:22,291
-你觉得能逃脱惩罚吗？ 我背叛谁了？
-Did you think you'd escape punishment? Disloyal to who?

348
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,823
你在时间守护者的房间里 他们不是真实的
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.

349
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,490
那又能改变什么？
And why does that change anything?

350
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,781
那改变了一切
That changes everything!

351
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,406
人们需要知道真相
The people need to know the truth.

352
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,406
不 时间变异管理局需要稳定
No, the TVA needs stability.

353
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:37,208
在我们弄清楚怎么回事之前 它就必须要这样
And until we figure out what's going on, that is what it will get.

354
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:42,500
所以你得把一切告诉我
So you need to tell me everything.

355
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,125
你到底想要从我这得到什么？
What exactly do you want from me?

356
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,031
你和那个时间犯有联系
You had a link with the Variant.

357
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,073
我需要你告诉我她的动机
I want you to tell me what drives her.

358
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,791
她的动机就是复仇
Revenge drives her.

359
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,823
杀死时间守护者
Killing the Time-Keepers.

360
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:01,615
但是结果他们是假的 你不会忘了吧
But they turned out to be fake, in case you forgot.

361
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,000
所以她要去寻找创造他们的人
So she'll be searching for whomever created them.

362
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,791
这根本不是为了保护时间变异管理局 是不是？
This isn't about protecting the TVA at all, is it?

363
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,166
你就是想找到幕后的主使
You just want to find whoever is behind all of this, too.

364
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,323
你永远也找不到他们
You'll never find them.

365
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,281
至少不会比她先找到
Not before she does.

366
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,291
为什么？
And why is that?

367
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,375
你只是想找到
You only want it.

368
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,166
她是非找到不可
She needs it.

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,156
你好啊
Hey, y'all.

370
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,406
我需要所有时间变异管理局创立的文件
I need all the files on the founding of the TVA.

371
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,365
时间起始之后的一切
Everything from the beginning of time.

372
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,156
这个要求可有点难办
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

373
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,948
这个地方的缔造者正身处险境
Whoever created this place is in danger.

374
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,573
我得找到他们
I need to find them.

375
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,666
收到 立即行动 长官
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

376
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,823
你真的不记得他了吗？
CLASSIC LOKI: You really don't remember him?

377
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,281
我的意思是 时间变异管理局 逮捕了很多洛基
MOBIUS: I mean, the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

378
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,948
但是 不 我不记得有条短吻鳄
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

379
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,041
而且 谁说他是个洛基的时间犯？
I mean, who's to say he's even a Loki Variant?

380
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,573
他是绿的 对不对？
He is green, isn't he?

381
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,115
我不知道 他可能在撒谎
I don't know, he could be lying.

382
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:40,365
隐姓埋名啊 当然 那只会让他更像是个洛基
The long con. Of course, that just makes him more likely to be a Loki.

383
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:45,375
你们这些家伙总是环环相扣的 这一点我很欣赏
It's always the game within the game with you guys, which I respect.

384
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,865
莫比乌斯
KID LOKI: Mobius,

385
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,791
假设你能回到时间变异管理局
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

386
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,041
你到底会去做什么？
what exactly are you getting yourself into?

387
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,615
我也不知道
I don't know.

388
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,990
我想让人们知道真相
I'd like to let people know the truth.

389
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,323
那么做的话 你就背叛了
So just like that, you're turning on the very thing

390
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,323
你为之奉献毕生的东西
you devoted your life to.

391
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
改变永远不晚
Well, it's never too late to change.

392
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,166
我希望他们知道他们在做什么
I hope they know what they're doing.

393
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,458
莫比乌斯没那么坏
Mobius isn't so bad.

394
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,490
也没那么好
Or so good.

395
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,208
我觉得这就是我们合得来的原因
I think that's why we get along.

396
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,916
他很关心你
He cares about you.

397
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,083
有点冷
-It's cold. Mmm-hmm.

398
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,541
如果你愿意的话 我可以给你变一个
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

399
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,240
我说 你还不如给我变一件新的外衣
You could conjure me a new outfit.

400
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,666
你可不知道这件有多不舒服
You have no idea how uncomfortable something like this is.

401
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,281
所以…
So. . .

402
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:17,198
关于莫比乌斯和他的理论…
Mobius and his theory about. . .

403
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,365
对 对 关于我们的关连事件
Right, right. About our nexus event.

404
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,115
-都是胡说 对吧？ 绝对是 肯定是 我是说…
-Total rubbish, right? Absolutely. Of course. I mean. . .

405
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,281
我并不觉得那个时刻有什么不好
I don't mean that it wasn't a nice moment.

406
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,323
对 那个时刻棒极了 非常好
No, it was great. It was really nice.

407
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,531
听上去像是又一个 时间变异管理局的谎言
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

408
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:33,583
百分之百 我觉得肯定是
A hundred percent. I mean, totally. Yeah.

409
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,865
我不知道该怎么处理
I don't know how to do this.

410
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,416
我甚至都不知道咱们在干什么
I don't even know what we're doing.

411
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,375
我没有朋友
I don't have friends.

412
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,166
我没有…
I don't have. . .

413
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:58,031
任何人在身边
anyone.

414
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,698
好吧…
Well. . .

415
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,240
你有更重要的事要做 对吗？
there are more important things, right?

416
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,448
是吗？对 比如推翻时间变异管理局
Right? Yeah. Like bringing down the TVA.

417
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,073
甚至是拯救宇宙
Saving the universe, even.

418
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,791
不用这么夸张 但是 算是吧
Well, there's no need to be dramatic, but, yeah, kind of.

419
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,198
这不是很舒服
It's not very snuggly.

420
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,198
-好吧 这是桌布吗？
Okay. Is it a tablecloth?

421
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,958
不 这是个毯子
No, it's a blanket.

422
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,666
谢谢你
Thank you.

423
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,416
不客气
My pleasure.

424
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,948
我怎么能确定 在最后的时刻 你不会背叛我？
How do I know that, in the final moments, you won't betray me?

425
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:02,250
听着 希尔维 我…
Listen, Sylvie, I. . .

426
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,583
我背叛了所有爱过我的人
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

427
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,041
我背叛了我的父亲 我的哥哥…
I betrayed my father, my brother. . .

428
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,416
还有我的家园
my home.

429
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,666
我知道我的所作所为
I know what I did.

430
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,750
而且我知道为什么要那么做
And I know why I did it.

431
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,250
那已经不是现在的我了
And that's not who I am anymore.

432
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,833
好吗？
Okay?

433
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,333
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

434
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
你确定吗？
You sure?

435
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,541
因为如果我们成功了 时间变异管理局不在了
'Cause if we make it, and the TVA is gone,

436
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,625
就会有一条时间线交给你来主宰
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

437
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,708
那我总算可以满足了
Ah. And then I'd finally be happy.

438
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
那你呢？
What about you?

439
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,791
这一切结束以后 你要去做什么？
What will you do when this is all over?

440
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
我不知道
I don't know.

441
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,291
我也不知道
I don't know either.

442
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,250
也许
Maybe. . .

443
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,416
也许我们可以…
Maybe we could figure it out. . .

444
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,666
一起弄明白
together.

445
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,250
也许吧
Maybe.

446
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,531
好吧 下一步怎么做？
Okay, so what's the next move?

447
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,531
我们要推翻时间变异管理局
SYLVIE: The TVA needs to be brought down.

448
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,823
我们不知道是谁创造了它 也不知道他们在哪里
We don't know who created it or where they are,

449
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,490
但是那个东西知道
but that thing out there does.

450
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,198
之前它攻击我的时候 我和它连接了
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.

451
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,365
时间很短 但是那一瞬间我看到了
It was brief, but I caught a glimpse of something,

452
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,531
如果足够接近 我就能附身在它身上
and I think if I can get close enough to it, I can enchant it,

453
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:20,416
这样就能找出真正的幕后主使
and it's gonna take me to whoever's behind all of this.

454
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,875
我要留下来
I'm staying.

455
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:44,916
-洛基 我不知道能不能成功 你去 我就去
-Loki, I don't know if this is gonna work. You go, I go.

456
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,031
快要出现了 伙计们 分支就在那里
It's happening, guys. The branch will be right out there.

457
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,948
我会替你向洛斯蕾尔问好的
MOBIUS: I'll give your regards to Renslayer.

458
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,281
请务必把我的问候带到
Oh, please do.

459
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,115
你们想从这出去吗？
You boys want a ticket out of here?

460
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,698
什么？不 我们要留在这里
What? No. We're staying here.

461
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,781
这是我们的家
This is our home.

462
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,448
你们确定吗？那艾里奥斯呢？
Are you sure? What about Alioth?

463
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,781
我们已经活了这么久了 我们知道该怎么做
We've survived this long. We know what we're doing.

464
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,531
洛基 你的旅途上需要这个
Loki, you're gonna need this on your journey.

465
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,541
拿着吧
Go on.

466
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:33,531
祝你们好运
CLASSIC LOKI: Good luck.

467
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,458
希望你们能得偿所望
I hope you find what you're looking for.

468
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:49,125
看来你最后还是脱身了
Looks like you got away in the end.

469
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,083
我一贯如此
I always do.

470
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,000
回到时间变异管理局以后 你要干什么？
What will you do at the TVA?

471
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:00,375
把它烧成灰烬
Burn it to the ground.

472
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,000
感谢你的星星之火
Thanks for the spark.

473
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,666
回头见 洛基
Well, see you later, Loki.

474
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,833
谢谢你 我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

475
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,166
你是我的最爱
You're my favorite.

476
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,615
分支出现的时候 就会吸引艾里奥斯的注意力
SYLVIE: When a branch appears, Alioth will focus on it.

477
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,083
那就是我附身的机会
That's when I'll enchant it.

478
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,281
如果我们没有时间等待分支出现呢？
What if we don't have time to wait for a branch?

479
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:53,208
咱们得分散它的注意力
We'll have to cause a distraction.

480
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,750
来啊 抓我啊
Come and get me!

481
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,198
不 来这边
LOKI: No! This way!

482
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,750
来抓我啊
Come and get me!

483
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,125
不 不
No! No!

484
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,916
他是怎么做到的？
How is he doing that?

485
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,500
我觉得我们比想象的更强大
I think we're stronger than we realize.

486
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,000
上吧
Go!

487
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,115
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

488
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,156
我们要附身在它身上
SYLVIE: We're gonna enchant it.

489
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,948
我不知道怎么做
LOKI: I don't know how.

490
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,073
你知道
SYLVIE: You do.

491
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,708
因为咱们是一样的
Because we're the same!

492
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:14,333
这是光荣的使命
Glorious purpose!

493
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,000
睁开眼吧
Open your eyes.
