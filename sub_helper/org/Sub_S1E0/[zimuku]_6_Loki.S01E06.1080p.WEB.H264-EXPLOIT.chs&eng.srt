你并非生而为王 洛基

你背叛了时间变异管理局
You were disloyal to the TVA.

9
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,281
你在时间守护者的房间里 他们不是真实的
HUNTER B-15: You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers. They weren't real.

10
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,916
-那又能改变什么？ -那改变了一切

你们两个造成的关连事件
MOBIUS: The nexus event the two of you caused,

12
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,615
不管是什么关系 会让这个地方崩溃
whatever that connection is,  can bring this whole place down.

我从来没有经历过 在拉曼迪斯的时候…
This is new for me. Back on Lamentis. . .

我们要寻找的人 就在虚空之外时间的尽头
SYLVIE: The person we're after is beyond The Void at the end of time.

16
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,323
这个东西就是守卫着唯一入口的看门狗
That thing is just their guard dog protecting the only way in.

17
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,656
-那我们怎么绕过这只看门狗？ -我要附身在它身上
-How do we get past the guard dog?  -I'm gonna enchant it.

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,875

She's pretty confident.

我们要跳上那艘大飞船离开这里 一起来吗？
KORG: We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Wanna come?

29
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,573
我们认为时间是一种单向的运动

睁开眼吧
MAYA ANGELOU: I will rise. SYLVIE: Open your eyes.

37

你不阻止我一脚把门踹开吗？
Aren't you gonna tell me not to kick the door in?

39
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,083

It never made a difference.

40

-只是 你平时… -洛基 闭嘴

同时不会影响其它的事情
in a way that won't disrupt things.

〝不会影响其它的事情〞？

纽约之战啊 傻瓜

00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,031
而且不止于此
But not just there.

逃跑了这么多年
All those years on the run.

83
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,240
绝望 孤独
Desperate, alone.

84

你想不想明天早上醒来 脑海里只有快乐的回忆？
How would you like to wake up tomorrow with just a lifetime of happy memories?

85
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,791
两个洛基在同一个地方

86
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,333

你们可以一起得到一切
And you can have it all, together.

93
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,583
这不是真的
It's fiction.

94
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,000
现在起我们自己写命运
We write our own destiny now.

95
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:18,125
随你的便 祝你好运
Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that.

96
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,541

我知道 但是他觉得这些更有用
I know, but he thinks this'll be more useful.

104

SYLVIE: Not for much longer.

108
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,750
他真的还活着吗？
Are we sure he's even still alive?

109
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,000
太令人激动了

110
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,198
你们两个 同一个人
. . . same person.

111
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:38,416
有点不同寻常 但是…
I mean, it's a little unnatural. But. . .

112
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,958
Wow!

113
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,875

她还是这么称呼我吗？
She still calls me that?

117
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,041
有点诡异 是不是？但是…
Creepy, right? But. . .

118
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500

I like it.

119
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,250
来吧 来吧 咱们去我办公室聊
Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office.

120
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,083
和你们想象的不一样？
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

121
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,416
你就是…一个普通人
You're just. . . a man.

122
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,916
有血有肉的普通人
Mmm. Flesh and blood.

123
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,990
-别告诉我你们很失望 -没有
-Don't tell me I'm a disappointment.  -No.

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,750
这样杀掉你更容易了
Just a little bit easier to kill.

125
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,625
进来吧
Come on in.

126
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,875
一杯…
HE WHO REMAINS: One. . .

127
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,250
两杯
Two.

128
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,708
请坐
Please, take a seat.

129
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,375
洛基
Uh, Loki.

130
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,041
洛基
Loki.

131
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,708
两份糖
Two sugars.

132
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,531
我说过不要打扰我
-I said I wasn't to be disturbed.

133
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,500
那估计你不想见到我
Well, then you're not gonna be happy to see me.

134
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,000
他回来了
He's back.

135
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,156
如果能有人从虚空活着回来
If anyone was ever gonna make it back from The Void,

136
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,573
我觉得那人肯定是你
I suppose it was gonna be you.

137
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:12,500
对某些人是绝望虚空 对某些人是小菜一碟
Oh, well, you know, one man's Void is another man's piece of cake.

138
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,365
-那么 你要裁剪掉我吗？ -这主意不错
-So, you're gonna prune me?  -I like that idea.

139
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,656
但我的标准可能比你要稍微高那么一点
But, you know, my standards might be a little bit higher in that area than yours.

140
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:25,791
-在对待亲密伙伴这件事上 -我很抱歉 莫比乌斯
-You know, with close personal friends.  -I'm sorry, Mobius.

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,156
我不能让你阻碍我们的使命
I couldn't let you get in the way of our mission.

142
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,240
使命？
Mission?

143
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,573
时间守护者是假的 我们都是时间犯 还有什么使命？
The Time-Keepers are fake.  We're all Variants. What mission?

144
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:37,208
这一切不可能毫无意义 这就是为什么我要裁剪掉你
It can't have been for nothing.  That's why I had to prune you.

145
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,406
追捕者D-90 立刻来我办公室
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

146
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:42,698
抱歉 拉芙娜 你可能要失望了
Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna work out the way you think it is,

147
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,781
富兰克林 D 罗斯福高中
now that we know your secret.

148
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,416
我们知道你的秘密了

149
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,958
你干了什么？
What did you do?

150
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,583
保持警惕 她就在附近
HUNTER U-92: Stay alert, she's close.

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,406
俄亥俄州 弗里蒙特

152
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,490
2018年
Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

153
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,115
包围这里 我找到她了

154
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,000
富兰克林 D 罗斯福高中

155
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,156
投降吧 B-15
Stand down, B-15.

156
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,698
你得听我说
You need to listen to me.

157
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,115
-有你说的时候 -等等
-HUNTER U-92: There'll be time for that.  -Just wait.

158
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,250
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is going on here?

159
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,865
洛斯蕾尔法官
Judge Renslayer.

160
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,406
什么？
What?

161
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,990
你们是谁？你们在我的学校里干什么？
Who are you? And what the hell are you doing in my school?

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,958
那不是洛斯蕾尔法官

163
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,573
怎么会这样？
How?

164
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,416
咱们要聊的还多着呢
We have a lot to talk about.

165
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,000
你这一路走来可不容易啊 是不是？
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?

166
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,365
东躲西藏 艰难困苦
Lot of running, lot of pain.

167
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,666
而你…

168
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,448
你就像是龙背上的跳蚤
You're a flea on the back of a dragon.

169
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,073
就像搭便车一样
In for one hell of a ride.

170
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,666
但是你没有被甩掉
But you did manage to hang on.

171
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,073
我觉得也挺不容易的
Mmm-hmm. I guess that counts for something.

172
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,906
我不知道你是否了解现在的处境
I'm not sure you quite understand the situation.

173
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,916
你输了
You've lost.

174
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,583
我们找到你了
We found you.

175
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,750
当然了
Duh. Of course you did.

176
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,000
手起刀落没打着
-Whoa! A swing and a miss.

177
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,041
我们还要继续这样吗？
So, we're still doing that, hmm?

178
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,250
咱们把话说清楚
Let's get all this out of the way.

179
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,541
好了
Okay.

180
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,583
就在这
Here we go.

181
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,656
你杀不了我 因为
You can't kill me because

182
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,291
我已经知道要发生什么了
I already know what's going to happen.

183
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,573
你看？
See?

184
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,240
我不知道你是否了解现在的处境 你输了 我们找到你了

185
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,250
当然了

186
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,115
这就是小把戏
It's a parlor trick.

187
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,531
好吧
Okay.

188
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:49,990
你们难道不奇怪 我是怎么在你们动手前逃脱的吗？
Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out of the way just before you kill me?

189
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,781
不奇怪 因为你有时间控制器
No. It's because of that little TemPad you have there.

190
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,865
没错
HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

191
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:59,573
但是我怎么能提前输入需要的东西
But how do I already have it loaded up with everything I need to know

192
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,833
让你们杀不了我呢？
to keep from being killed by you two?

193
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,198
答案很简单
It's easy.

194
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,166
我无所不知
I know it all.

195
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,041
我洞悉一切
And I've seen it all.

196
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,323
我看到了你们在拉曼迪斯上的所作所为
Everything you guys did on Lamentis, I saw.

197
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,281
我知道时间变异管理局不知道的一切
All the stuff the TVA didn't know about, I knew.

198
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,990
所有的密谋 所有的…
All the scheming, all the. . .

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
交谈
. . . talking.

200
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,958
你们在湖边的小眼神
That little look by the lake.

201
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:36,291
还真是柔情似水 感人至深呢
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff,  by the way.

202
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,990
不
No.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,031
不 我们打破了你的游戏规则 所以才能来到这里
No, we broke out of your little game.  That's how we got here.

204
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,906
不对 大错特错
HE WHO REMAINS: No, wrong.

205
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:48,031
你们来到这里的每一步
Every step you took to get here,

206
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,323
拉曼迪斯也好 虚空也罢
Lamentis, The Void,

207
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:56,541
是我为你们铺好了路
I paved the road.

208
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,916
你们…
You. . .

209
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,500
你们只是走过来了而已
You just walked down it.

210
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,490
剩下的全都在这里
And I have the rest,  uh, right here.

211
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,208
所有…
Everything that's, uh. . .

212
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,323
即将发生的一切 这是事情发展唯一的可能性
that's going to happen.  There's only one way this can go.

213
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,323
那我们为什么要来这里？
Then why are we here?

214
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,583
不是吧
Oh, come on.

215
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,656
你们知道 没有旅途中自我的蜕变 你们根本到不了终点
You know you can't get to the end until you've been changed by the journey.

216
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,198
这些事情 必须要发生
This stuff, it needs to happen.

217
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:35,865
所有人都有正确的观念 任务才能完成
To get us all in the right mindset to finish the quest.

218
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,240
-没错 -没错
-Right.  -HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

219
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,656
所以这一切就是个游戏
So, it's all a game.

220
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,406
这一切都是…背后的操控
It's all. . . a manipulation.

221
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:48,583
你会这么想啊 真有趣
Interesting, that your head would go to that.

222
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,990
希尔维
Sylvie,

223
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,073
你觉得你能相信这个家伙吗？
you think you can trust this guy?

224
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,823
-别听他说的 -〝别听他说的〞
-Don't listen to him.  -"Don't listen to him. "

225
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:01,666
你觉得你还有能力相信任何人吗？
Do you think you're even capable of trusting anyone at all?

226
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,948
我认为人们应该知道真相
I think people are ready to hear a little truth now.

227
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,740
比如 时间变异管理局是个谎言
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

228
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,541
但是如果这个谎言是必要的呢？
But what if it's a necessary one?

229
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,740
某人创造了时间守护者
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

230
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,656
他们创造了整个地方 他们给予我们目的
They created this whole place.  They gave us all purpose.

231
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,948
我必须相信 他们有理由这么做
I have to believe they had a reason.

232
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,323
不 因为我看到了那些被裁剪的人们 等待他们的恐怖现实
No, because I've seen the horror waiting for people when they get pruned

233
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,198
那一切根本没有任何必要
and there's nothing necessary about that.

234
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,198
你知道如果我们不裁剪时间线 会发生什么吗？
You know what would happen if we didn't prune the Timeline?

235
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,198
-什么？ -混乱 死亡
-MOBIUS: What?  -Chaos. Death.

236
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,781
自由意志？
Free will?

237
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,448
自由意志？
Free will?

238
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:39,250
只有一个人能有自由意志 就是掌管这一切的人
Only one person gets free will.  The one in charge.

239
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,281
〝跨越时间的友谊 最后的盟友〞
"Friends across time, allies to the end. "

240
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,490
-闭嘴 -说得多好听啊
-Shut up.  -MOBIUS: That was so beautiful.

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,406
然后你就让我去送死 你怎么了？
And then you sent me to die.  What happened to you?

242
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,406
没怎么 莫比乌斯 我一点也没变
Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

243
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,115
你没变？你背叛了我
You didn't change? You betrayed me.

244
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,875
不对 是你背叛了我
No, no. You betrayed me!

245
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,490
我为你着想 替你承担风险
I looked out for you,  hung my neck out for you,

246
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,250
然后你的信仰动摇了 就和那些时间犯同流合污了？
and you suffer a crisis of faith and turn to those Variants?

247
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,573
永恒的友谊
Eons of friendship.

248
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,990
因为几个洛基 你就把它丢弃了
And you threw it all away on a couple of Lokis.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,125
不 莫比乌斯 我没有背叛你
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

250
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:26,500
我们不能夺走人们的自由意志 拉芙娜 难道你不明白吗？
We can't take away people's free will,  Ravonna. Do you not see that?

251
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,573
-你在干什么？ -我必须要做的事
-What are you doing?  -What I need to do.

252
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,865
等等 住手
Wait, stop.

253
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:35,323
也许咱们可以一起把这里变得更好
Look, maybe we can build this into something better together.

254
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,791
抱歉 莫比乌斯
I'm sorry, Mobius.

255
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,375
我不会让你走的
I'm not gonna let you go.

256
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,458
别这样 莫比乌斯
RENSLAYER: Please, Mobius.

257
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,083
即使拿着那个
Even with that. . .

258
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,365
你对我也毫无威胁
you're of no danger to me.

259
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,698
你是这么想的吗？
Is that what you think?

260
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,875
那就试试看吧
Let's see.

261
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,615
对 你说得对

262
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,958
和当时一样
Back here again.

263
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,541
动手吧
Go ahead.

264
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,125
你要去哪？
Where are you gonna go?

265
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,708
去寻找自由意志
In search of free will.

266
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:36,416
我知道你们从道德上 反对时间变异管理局的所作所为
I understand your moral objections to what the TVA does.

267
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:43,823
我的方法也有欺骗性
And my methods are deceptive.

268
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,156
但是这个使命是真实的
But the mission, it never was.

269
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:52,583
没有我 没有时间变异管理局
Without the me, without the TVA. . .

270
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,625
一切都将毁灭
everything burns.

271
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,333
那你在害怕什么？
Then what are you so afraid of?

272
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,416
我自己
Me.

273
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,490
你到底是谁？
And just who are you?

274
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,541
很多人给我起过很多的名字
Oh, I've been dubbed many names by many people.

275
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,708
统治者 征服者
A ruler, a conqueror.

276
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,541
遗留之人 混蛋
He Who Remains, a jerk.

277
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:35,916
但是…这个名字背后可不简单
But it's. . . it's not as simple as a name.

278
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,781
无数年前 那时还没有时间变异管理局
Eons ago, before the TVA,

279
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:55,000
一个我自己的变体生活在31世纪的地球
a variant of myself lived on Earth in the 31st century.

280
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,573
他是一名科学家
He was a scientist

281
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:02,698
他发现在他的世界之上 还有多重宇宙
and he discovered that there were universes stacked on top of his own.

282
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,906
在同一时刻 其它版本的我们也意识到了这一点
At the same time, other versions of us were learning the same thing.

283
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:13,031
自然而然地 他们就有了交流 此后一段时间里 几方和平共处
Naturally, they made contact.  And for a while, there was peace.

284
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,990
这和平其实只是自我陶醉罢了
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,240
〝我喜欢你的鞋〞 〝你的发型真不错〞 〝这鼻子真漂亮〞 〝谢谢你呀〞
"I love your shoes. " "I love your hair. " "Oh, man, nice nose. " "Thanks, man. "

286
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,031
诸如此类
Et cetera.

287
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:26,250
他们彼此共享技术和知识
They shared technology and knowledge.

288
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:31,166
这些宇宙之间互相取长补短
Using the best of their universes to improve the others.

289
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,541
但是…
However. . .

290
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,781
并非每个版本的我
not every version of me

291
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,750
想法都如此单纯
was so. . . so pure of heart.

292
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,656
对于某些我自己而言 新世界的唯一意义
To some of us,  new worlds meant only one thing,

293
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,708
就是新的征服目标
new lands to be conquered.

294
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,833
现实之间的和平共处
The peace between realities. . .

295
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,198
演变成了全面爆发的战争
. . . erupted into all-out war,

296
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,573
每个变体都在为自己宇宙的存续而战
each variant fighting to preserve their universe

297
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,500
同时毁灭其它宇宙
and annihilate the others.

298
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,198
宇宙几近末日

299
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,573
女士们先生们 这是一切的末日
. . . ladies and gentlemen,  of everything and everyone.

300
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:19,698
然后时间守护者就出现了 拯救了所有人
And then the Time-Keepers came along and saved us all.

301
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:27,041
阿门
Amen

302
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,865
不 不
No.

303
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,323
不是 从这里开始 和教义里就不一样了
Nope, this is where we diverge from the dogma.

304
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,198
最初的变体遇到了一个生物
That first variant encountered a creature

305
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,490
由现实中的悲痛凝结而成
created from all the tears in reality,

306
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,865
能够自我吞噬时间和空间
capable of consuming time and space itself.

307
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,875
这个生物
A creature. . .

308
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,125
你们都知道
you both know.

309
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,990
艾里奥斯
Alioth.

310
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,573
答对了
HE WHO REMAINS: Bingo!

311
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:58,250
我驾驭了这个野兽的力量 开始对它进行实验
I harnessed the beast's power and began experimenting on it.

312
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:05,041
我把它变成了武器
I weaponized Alioth

313
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,291
然后我结束了…这场多元宇宙大战
and I ended. . .  I ended the Multiversal War.

314
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,708
把我们的时间线隔离出来以后
Once I isolated our timeline,

315
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,198
我要做的就是管理时间的流动
all I had to do was manage the flow of time

316
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,156
防止出现其它的分支
and prevent any further branches.

317
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,698
因此就有了时间变异管理局
Hence, the TVA.

318
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,656
因此就有了时间守护者和整个高效的官僚体系
Hence, the Time-Keepers and a highly efficient bureaucracy.

319
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:31,031
因此就有了数个时代的宇宙和平
. . . and ages of cosmic harmony.

320
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,281
因此就有了…
Hence. . .

321
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,458
不客气
you're welcome.

322
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,583
你们是来讨伐恶魔的 对吗？
You came to kill the devil, right?

323
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,666
结果你猜怎么着？
Well, guess what?

324
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,323
我在保护你们的安全
I keep you safe.

325
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:57,916
如果你们觉得我是邪恶的
And if you think I'm evil, well,

326
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:04,208
等你们见到我的那些变体 你们就明白了
just wait till you meet my variants.

327
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,208
这就是一场赌局
And that's the gambit.

328
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,865
是要压抑窒息的秩序 还是要毁天灭地的混乱
Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.

329
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,615
你们也许痛恨独裁者 但是
You may hate the dictator,  but something. . .

330
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:25,541
如果没有他 可能会更糟糕
. . . far worse is gonna fill that void if you depose of him.

331
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,916
我已经活了上百万次
I've lived a million lifetimes.

332
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,573
我经历了每一种可能性
I've gone through every scenario.

333
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,625
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

334
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,083
时间变异管理局
The TVA,

335
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,906
它行之有效
it works.

336
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:46,041
也许你是个骗子
Or you're a liar.

337
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,375
也许我是个骗子
Or I'm a liar.

338
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,083
所以你就要…
So you just. . .

339
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:00,198
继续裁剪无辜的时间线？
continue to prune innocent timelines?

340
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,208
Mmm-mmm.

341
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,333
交给你们两个
You two would.

342
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,791
有两个选择 一
There's two options! One. . .

343
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,698
你们杀掉我 毁掉这一切 你们要面对的恶魔就不止一个
you kill me and destroy all this,  so you don't just have one devil,

344
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:17,125
将会是无数个 或者…
you have an infinite amount. Or. . .

345
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,115
你们两个
you two.

346
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,323
你们两个来掌控这一切
You two run the thing.

347
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,333
你在说谎
You're lying.

348
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,791
为什么你要放弃掌控？
Why would you give up being in control?

349
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,666
哥们…
Buddy. . .

350
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,375
我累了
I'm tired.

351
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,041
而且我也老了
And I'm older.

352
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,583
我比看上去更老
I'm older than I look.

353
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:57,166
这是个年轻人的游戏 要充满渴望
This game is for the young, the hungry.

354
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,458
我经历了无数种可能性…
I've gone through a lot of scenarios. . .

355
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,708
试图找到合适的接替者
trying to find the right person to take this spot.

356
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:13,500
结果居然是两个人
It turns out that person came in two.

357
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:20,916
但是你们两个肯定没问题
But it's definitely you two.

358
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,958
就这样 没有什么谎言了
So, no more lies.

359
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,906
你们杀了我 神圣时间线就会完全失去保护
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline is completely exposed.

360
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,323
结果就是多元宇宙大战
Multiversal War.

361
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:36,823
或者你们接手 然后回到时间变异管理局 去做仁慈的统治者
Or you take over and return to the TVA as its benevolent rulers.

362
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:42,291
告诉那里的人他们是谁 还有他们所做的一切的意义
Tell the workforce who they are and why they do what they do.

363
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:47,823
你把真实的人生视同儿戏
You treated real people's lives like some kind of game.

364
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:52,073
我不针对任何人 这是最有效的罢了
It's not personal, it's practical.

365
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,865
我觉得被针对了
It was personal to me.

366
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:59,115
成熟点 成熟点 希尔维
Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie!

367
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,041
杀人犯 伪君子
Murderer! Hypocrite!

368
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,416
我们都不是什么好人

369
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:11,416
我们都做过可怕的 恐怖的事情
We've all done horrible,  terrible, horrific things.

370
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,833
但是现在 我们 你们
But now, we, you. . .

371
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:24,166
有机会去合理正当地做那些事
have a chance to do them for a good reason.

372
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,458
我们刚刚越过了…
We just crossed. . .

373
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,166
那道门槛
the threshold.

374
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,541
-Oh.

375
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:20,250
我说谎了
So, I fibbed.

376
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,240
我刚才说我知道一切会怎么样 我是骗人的
I fibbed earlier when I said I know how everything's going to go. I. . .

377
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,031
我知晓…我曾经知晓一切 到某个点为止的一切
. . . everything up to a certain point,

378
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,875
那个点大概是…
and that point was about. . .

379
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,458
七 八 九 十秒以前的事了
seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.

380
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,031
但是现在我什么都不知道了
But now I have no idea.

381
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:46,500
我不知道接下来会何去何从
No idea how the rest of this is going to go.

382
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,791
我很坦诚
I'm being candid.

383
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,708
所以就这样了？
So, that's it?

384
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,365
就这样了？
That's it?

385
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,375
这就是时间的尽头？
This is what happens at the end of time?

386
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,833
你就这么自由地坐在那 然后…
And now you're just gonna sit there with all that freedom and. . .

387
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,656
让我们决定你的命运？
let us decide your fate?

388
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,906
是的
Yes!

389
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,323
是的 是的 还能有什么坏事呢？
Yes! Yes! What's the worst that can happen?

390
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,198
你们要不然…
You either. . .

391
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:20,115
接手并继续我毕生的工作
take over and my life's work continues

392
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:26,583
要不然就一剑捅死我 然后无数个我
or you plunge a blade in my chest and an infinite amount of me. . .

393
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:31,323
会开始另一场多元宇宙大战 而我…
start another Multiversal War.  And I just. . .

394
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:34,166
最终还是会回到这里

395
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,198
这就是转世 宝贝
Reincarnation, baby.

396
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:42,240
不 这就是另一个谎言
No, it's just another lie.

397
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,875
另一种背后的操控
Another manipulation.

398
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,416
没有谎言
Oh. No lie.

399
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,458
没有操控
No manipulation.

400
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,833
Wow.

401
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,708
我喜欢这样
I love this.

402
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:30,125
我喜欢…这种诚实
I love. . . all this honesty.

403
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,625
感觉就像全新的开始
Feels like a fresh start.

404
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,781
该死…
-Oh, holy. . .  -

405
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,615
-你在干什么？ -等一下
-SYLVIE: What're you doing?  -Hang on a moment.

406
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,865
咱们先谈谈
Let's just talk about it.

407
00:30:56,875 --> 00:31:00,250
咱们来了结这一切 杀了他怎么样？
Well, how about we finish what we started and kill him?

408
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:06,531
-如果他说的是真的呢？ -那又怎么样？
-What if he's telling the truth?  -So what?

409
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,906
-我相信他 -相信什么？
-I believe him.  -Believe what?

410
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,698
一大群怪人会出现
That a bazillion boogeymen will turn up

411
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,448
就因为我们让人们有了自由意志？
just because we give people free will?

412
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,365
-他是个骗子 洛基 -我也是
-He's a liar, Loki.  -So am I.

413
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,073
我觉得他没有说谎 至少这件事上没有
And I don't think he was lying.  Not about that.

414
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,656
很疯狂是吗？没错 但是也许他说的是真话
Insane? Yes.  But maybe he was telling the truth.

415
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,073
最好尽快 时间线已经开始分支了
Better hurry.  Timeline's already branching.

416
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,406
-所以你有什么建议？ -我们再考虑一下
-So, what are you suggesting?  -That we think about it.

417
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:25,615
到底要考虑什么？
And what precisely is there to think about?

418
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,823
你没听见他说的话吗？
Weren't you listening to what he was saying?

419
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,406
这就是一场赌局
That's the gambit.

420
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,708
消灭了独裁者 谁来填补空缺？
Remove the dictator and what fills the void?

421
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,625
Ah.

422
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,823
你想要这个王位吗？
You want the throne?

423
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,740
不 不是这样的 不是
No, that's not it. No.

424
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,490
-我不相信你 -希尔维 宇宙是平衡的
-I don't believe you.  -Sylvie, the universe is in the balance,

425
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,250
我们所知的一切都是真的 所有这一切
everything we know to be true. Everything.

426
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,156
我知道时间变异管理局伤害了我们
I know the TVA has hurt us both.

427
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,865
但是如果我们杀了他
But what if by taking him out,

428
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,625
事情可能会变得更糟糕呢？
we risk unleashing something even worse?

429
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,708
我建议的就是咱们再考虑一下
All I'm suggesting is we just take a minute to think about it.

430
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,115
我发自内心向你保证 这和那个王位无关
I promise you from my heart this isn't about a throne.

431
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,166
我是怎么想的才会相信你？
What was I thinking trusting you?

432
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,656
所有这一切都是个骗局吗？
Has this whole thing been a con?

433
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,666
真的吗？
Really?

434
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,791
这就是你对我的看法…
That's what you think of me. . .

435
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,781
经历了这一切以后？
after all this time?

436
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,041
当然 为什么不是？
Sure. Why not?

437
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,531
邪恶的洛基的计划终于得逞了
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

438
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,750
你从来没有相信过我 是不是？ 这有什么意义？
Well, you never trusted me, did you?  What was the point?

439
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:30,948
你不明白吗？这比我们的遭遇要更重要
Can't you see?  This is bigger than our experience.

440
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,666
为什么在这事上我们的观点不能一致？
Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

441
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,833
因为你不能相信人…
Because you can't trust. . .

442
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,833
而我不值得被信任
and I can't be trusted.

443
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,490
我觉得咱们陷入僵局了
Then I guess we're in a pickle.

444
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
希尔维 等等
Sylvie, wait.

445
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,166
等一下
Wait.

446
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,073
希尔维 希尔维
-Sylvie. Sylvie.  -

447
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,823
也许他在说谎 也许他没有
Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not.

448
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,781
错误的代价太大了
The cost of getting this wrong is too great.

449
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,240
好吧 动手吧
Fine. Do it.

450
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,906
杀了我 接受你的王位
