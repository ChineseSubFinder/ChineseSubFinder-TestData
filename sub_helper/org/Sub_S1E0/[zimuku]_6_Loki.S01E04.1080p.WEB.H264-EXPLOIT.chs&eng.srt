1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,990
所以你就是时间变异管理局 勤劳勇敢的工作人员？
LOKI: So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,073
是的
Yes.

3
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:09,240
你是时间守护者创造的？
You were created by the Time-Keepers?

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250
没错
Correct.

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,656
前情提要

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,531
为我工作的分析师又不止你一个
RAVONNA: You're not the only analyst working for me.

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,031
但是我是不是你最喜欢的那个？
But, would you say,  maybe, I'm your favorite one?

8
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,823
附身这一招挺聪明
LOKI: Enchantment is a clever trick.

9
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,948
我就需要创造一个他们记忆中的幻想
SYLVIE: I have to create a fantasy from their memories.

10
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:28,333
那个时间变异管理局的年轻士兵 她就是个地球上的普通人
That young soldier from the TVA,  she was just a regular person on Earth.

11
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,531
时间控制器储存的所有末日里 这是最糟糕的
Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,323
没人能活下来
No one makes it off here!

13
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,406
咱们还有多长时间？
LOKI: How long do we have?

14
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,490
12个小时左右 这里的情况只会越来越糟
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so.  Things down hereare only gonna get worse.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,605
敬世界末日
To the end of the world.

16
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,906
巨龙冲向宫殿
Dragon swoops towards the palace,

17
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:03,416
女武神飞驰而至 击败了巨龙 拯救了阿斯加德
the Valkyrie flies over,  defeats the dragon, and saves Asgard.

18
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,416
时间犯在那里
There's our Variant.

19
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,573
根据时间守护者授予的权力
On the authority of the Time-Keepers,

20
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,250
我以侵犯神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你
I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,948
重置它
Reset it.

22
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,958
等等
Wait!

23
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,708
时间变异管理局 永恒常相伴

24
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,291
不要 不要
MAN: No! No!

25
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,666
救救他
Help him!

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,916
下一个案件
Next case!

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,916
-下一个案件 -来了
-Next case!  -Right here!

28
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:05,375
《洛基》

29
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,031
他们怎么说的？你还好吗？
What'd they say? Are you okay?

30
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,990
不 莫比乌斯 我不好
No, no, Mobius. I'm not.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,698
即便不出任何差错
Under the best of circumstances,

32
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,698
站在时间守护者面前也很有压力
it's jarring to stand before the Time-Keepers.

33
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,740
更不用说现在一团糟了
And this is not the best of circumstances.

34
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,656
是的 但是这不能怪你
Yeah, but they can't blame you.

35
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,073
他们就是这么做的
They can and do.

36
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,823
时间犯来到了这里
The Variant was right here.

37
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,990
如果她找到了时间守护者呢？
What if she got to the Time-Keepers?

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,490
我知道 但是她没找到
I know. But she didn't.

39
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,448
是的 但是她逃跑了
No. But she got away.

40
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,708
和另一个时间犯一起 他能来这还是我帮你申请的许可
Along with the Variant that I got you permission to bring in here.

41
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:52,198
你知道保持时间线稳定有多难吗？
Do you have any idea how impossible it is to keep the timeline stable?

42
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,323
能保护我们免于全面毁灭的 只有时间守护者
The Time-Keepers are all that stand between us and full-scale calamity.

43
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,115
我很高兴他们站咱们这边
And I'm glad they're on our side.

44
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,490
但是如果他们想让我 找到洛基和那个时间犯
But if they want me to find Loki and the Variant,

45
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,865
我需要和追捕者C-20交谈
I need access to Hunter C-20.

46
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,615
抱歉 那是不可能的
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

47
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,365
咱们找到她的时候 她一直在说 〝那是真的 那是真的〞
Look, when we found her,  she kept saying, "It's real. It's real. "

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,323
一遍又一遍地重复 我得弄明白那是什么意思
Over and over.  I need to find out what that meant

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,573
还有她和那个时间犯在一起的时候 看到了什么其它的东西
and what else she saw when she was with the Variant.

50
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,656
我知道有规矩 但如果她能提供信息…
Look, I know there's protocol,  but she could have information. . .

51
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,406
她死了 莫比乌斯
She's dead, Mobius!

52
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,083
什么？怎么死的？
What? How?

53
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:30,458
那个时间犯 她附身在C-20身上 扰乱了她的心智
The Variant, she enchanted C-20,  scrambled her mind.

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,615
我不理解 她看上去没事啊 她看上去挺好的
I don't get it. She seemed okay.  She seemed fine.

55
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,240
一开始是这样的
RAVONNA: At first, yes.

56
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,791
但是到这里的时候 她已经不能说话了
But by the time she got in here,  she could barely speak.

57
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,323
之后恶化的速度越来越快
The decline was steeper after that.

58
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,708
-我不知道 什么… -没人知道
-I didn't know. What. . .  -Nobody does.

59
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,875
我们也不想让其他人恐慌
We don't want people to panic.

60
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,865
这件事你能保密吗？
Can I trust you to keep that between us?

61
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
当然可以
Of course. Yes.

62
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,375
抱歉
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,865
只要那些时间犯仍然在逃
Every moment those Variants are out there,

64
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,073
我们就有危险
we're all in danger.

65
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,125
找到他们
Find them!

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,291
对不起
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,365
我记得阿斯加德
I remember Asgard.

68
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,323
不是很清楚 但是有印象
Not much, but I remember.

69
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:16,041
我的家乡 我的人民 我的生活
My home, my people, my life.

70
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:25,833
宇宙想要挣脱束缚 所以它创造了混乱
The universe wants to break free,  so it manifests chaos.

71
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,500
就比如我 出生就是诡计女神
Like me being born the Goddess of Mischief.

72
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:35,448
只要神圣时间线出现了明显的分支
And as soon as that created a big enough detour from the Sacred Timeline,

73
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:41,791
时间变异管理局就会出现 消除我所在的现实 然后把我抓起来
the TVA showed up, erased my reality,  and took me prisoner.

74
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,625
我当时只是个孩子
I was just a child.

75
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,916
我逃跑了
I escaped.

76
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:56,948
我偷了一个时间控制器 然后很长时间里一直在逃 不堪回首
Stole a TemPad and I ran for a long,  long time, which really sucked.

77
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:01,781
我所到的任何地方和任何时间 都会出现关连事件
Everywhere and every-when I went,  it caused a nexus event.

78
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,416
就会引起注意
Sent up a smoke flare.

79
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,240
因为我就不该存在
Because I'm not supposed to exist.

80
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,750
最后我找到了藏身之处
Until, eventually,  I figured out where to hide.

81
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,073
那就是我长大的地方
And so that's where I grew up,

82
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,333
无数个世界的终结
the ends of a thousand worlds.

83
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,541
现在
Now. . .

84
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,458
这就是我的葬身之处
. . . that's where I'll die.

85
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,115
什么都没有 长官
ANALYST 1: There's nothing, sir.

86
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,698
放大关连阈值也没有吗？
MOBIUS: Even with the magnified nexus threshold?

87
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,865
有任何小动静 都会触发警报
That one should be setting off alarms if somebody steps on the wrong leaf.

88
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,198
无论他们在哪 我觉得都很难活下来
ANALYST 2: Wherever they are,  I'm not sure anything survives.

89
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,406
别小看他们 你在罗克斯卡特看到什么了吗？
Yeah. Don't underestimate them.  You see anything down at Roxxcart?

90
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,698
他们消失了
They're gone.

91
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,958
他们在时间里穿行 谋划着下一次屠杀
Leaping across time,  plotting their next massacre.

92
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,250
C-20有什么消息吗？
Any news on C-20?

93
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,000
没有
No.

94
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,708
我们得找到他们
We need to find them.

95
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,666
我们会的
We will.

96
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,208
快了
SYLVIE: Not long now.

97
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,823
你觉得洛基之所以成为洛基
Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki

98
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,906
是不是我们注定要失败的宿命？
is the fact that we're destined to lose?

99
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,740
不是
LOKI: No.

100
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,333
我们可能会失败
We may lose.

101
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,875
有的时候惨不忍睹
Sometimes painfully.

102
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,281
但是我们死不了
But we don't die.

103
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,541
我们能活下来
We survive.

104
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,823
你不是活下来了嘛
I mean, you did.

105
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,823
时间变异管理局抓到你的时候 你只是个孩子
You were just a child when the TVA took you,

106
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,823
但是你几乎打败了 那个号称统治时间秩序的组织
but you nearly took down the organization that claims to govern the order of time.

107
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,906
你单枪匹马做到了
You did it on your own.

108
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,041
你比他们更厉害 你是最棒的
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!

109
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,073
我们发现了些东西
We've got something.

110
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,541
锁定现世光环
ANALYST 1: Temporal lock.

111
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,948
好吧 这可不是什么小动静
Okay, that's not someone stepping on the wrong leaf.

112
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,323
你们见过这样的分支吗？
You ever seen a branch like that?

113
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,708
从来没有
No.

114
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,073
-说呀？ -说什么？
MOBIUS: Well?  LOKI: Well, what?

115
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,031
我知道你肯定憋了一肚子话
I know you got some quip you're dyin' to say.

116
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,115
我没有 我没什么好说的
I don't have a quip.  I've got nothing to say.

117
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,240
不会吧
Come on.

118
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,323
话说回来 我的警卫应该和她一样多 你这是在侮辱我
By the way, I should have an equal amount of security. This is insulting!

119
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,906
你控制不了你自己
You just can't help yourself.

120
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,615
-你背叛了我 -是你背叛了我
-You betrayed me!  -You betrayed me!

121
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,656
-成熟点 -你成熟点
-Grow up!  -You grow up.

122
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,698
我忽然发现你根本不是什么诡计之神
MOBIUS: You know, it occurred to me that you're not really the God of Mischief.

123
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,073
又来了
LOKI: Oh, here it comes.

124
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,948
一介凡人对神的无知的羞辱
The folksy, dopey insult from the folksy dope.

125
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,198
那我是什么？自我陷害之神？ 背后捅刀子之神？
What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah?  The God of Back-Stabbing?

126
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,323
你就是个混蛋 是个差劲的朋友
Just kind of an asshole and a bad friend.

127
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,823
你自己去好好反思吧 好吧 准备好了
Yeah, chew on that for a little bit.  All right. It's ready.

128
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,906
这是什么？
What is this?

129
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,573
你会明白的
You'll see.

130
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,865
-莫比乌斯 -好吧 等等 让他说
-Mobius!  -Okay. No, no, no, let him,

131
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:04,073
看看这个走投无路的骗子还有什么花样 说吧
one last desperate trick from the desperate trickster. Go ahead.

132
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,833
时间变异管理局在欺骗你
The TVA is lying to you.

133
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,333
把他扔进去
Put him in.

134
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,041
不

135
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,625
什么？
What?

136
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,916
真的吗？
Seriously?

137
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,615
你
You.

138
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,698
希芙
Sif.

139
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,115
你这个狼狈为奸、胆小懦弱、可悲之极的蠕虫
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

140
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,708
-这是你干的 -什么？
-You did this.  -What?

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,656
你就活该一个人 永远如此
LOKI: Ow. I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.

142
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,906
好吧
All right.

143
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,416
这是个糟糕回忆的监牢吗？太老套了。
A bad memory prison? How quaint.

144
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,291
LOKI: Ow!

145
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,500
我受到了些惩罚

146
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,865
我记得特别清楚之后去干什么了
I remember exactly what I did after that.

147
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,656
我去美美地泡了个澡
I went and had a nice, hot bath

148
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:08,323
一杯酒下去 这件事就彻底忘了
and a glass of wine,  and I never thought about it again,

149
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,458
因为就是好玩而已
because it was just a bit of fun.

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,406
你
-SIF: You.  -Huh?

151
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,406
你这个狼狈为奸、胆小懦弱、可悲之极的蠕虫 这是你干的
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.  You did this.

152
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,281
等等
Hang on. Ow.

153
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,240
你就活该一个人 永远如此
I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.

154
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,500
等等
Just. . .

155
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,375
时间循环 妙极了
Time loops. How lovely.

156
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,490
你
You.

157
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,240
你这个狼狈为奸、胆小懦弱、可悲之极的蠕虫
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

158
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,000
好吧 好吧 希芙 等一下
Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.

159
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,281
不 你听好了 你就活该一个人…
No, you hear this.  You deserve to be alone. . .

160
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,615
永远如此 好吧 我明白了
And I always will be.  All right, I get it.

161
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,615
听着 你是一个过去场景的重构
Listen. You are a reconstruction of a past event

162
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,198
是掌控时间的那个组织创造出来的
created by the organization that controls all of time.

163
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,791
你得相信我 然后帮我逃出去 好吗？
So you need to trust me and you need to help me escape. Yeah?

164
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,000
好吧 很好
Okay, good.

165
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,416
可悲之极
Pathetic.

166
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,708
嘿
Hey.

167
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,656
你不是应该在审讯那个洛基时间犯吗？
Shouldn't you be interrogating the Loki Variant?

168
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,490
他正在时间监牢里被感化呢
He's softening in the Time Cell,

169
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,740
在他受教育的时候 我想和另一个时间犯谈谈
but while he marinates, I thought maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

170
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:39,031
不用了 继续去审问你的洛基 弄清楚那个关连分支是怎么回事
Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki and figure out what that nexus spike was.

171
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,323
我知道 但是我觉得如果能审问他们两个 我能更快找到答案
I know, but I think I can get there faster if I work 'em both together.

172
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,073
你说过我们都有各自的角色 我的角色就是…
You said we have a part to play,  and the part I play. . .

173
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,031
不必了 她太危险了
Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.

174
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,073
太危险了？不是吧 拉芙娜 我就是干这个的
Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna.  This is what I do.

175
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,333
那我就是干这个的
And this is what I do.

176
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,500
谁也别想和那个时间犯交谈
Nobody speaks with that Variant.

177
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,740
我觉得如果背后有主使 不太可能是洛基
I mean, if there's a mastermind here,  I don't think it's Loki.

178
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,115
很好
Good.

179
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,948
那让他老实交代应该不难
Then he should be the easiest to break.

180
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,406
搞定你的洛基 弄清楚那个分支是怎么回事
Work your Loki and figure out what caused that spike.

181
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,281
时间守护者盯着呢 莫比乌斯
Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.

182
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,573
他们一直盯着呢 〝搞定你的洛基 搞定你的洛基〞
They're always watching.  "Work your Loki, work your Loki. "

183
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,083
都快成我的口头禅了
That ought to be my mantra.

184
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,875
你还好吗？
You all right?

185
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,041
她在里面吗？
-Is she in there?  -Mm-hmm.

186
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,073
他们不会轻饶了她 是不是？
They don't go gently, do they?

187
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,490
你不是应该在审讯那个时间犯小伙伴吗？
Aren't you supposed to be interrogating your Variant pet?

188
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,698
我出来活动活动
Just stretching my legs.

189
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,073
咱们抓过克里人、泰坦巨人 还有吸血鬼
You know, we brought in Kree,  Titans, vampires.

190
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,573
为什么这两个没爹没妈的半神这么难对付？
Why is it the two orphan demigods are such a pain in the ass?

191
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,041
把另外那个带来不是你的主意嘛
And yet it was your idea to bring in another one.

192
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,531
也不光是我的主意吧
I'm happy to share credit for that idea.

193
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,125
莫比乌斯？
Mobius?

194
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,323
你在那里的时候洛基说什么了吗？
Did Loki say anything while you were in there?

195
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,958
是的 他说时间变异管理局在欺骗我
Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me.

196
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,166
为什么要问这个？
Why?

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,416
这是我的职责
Just doing my job.

198
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,281
你
-SIF: You.  -

199
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,865
你这个狼狈为奸、胆小怯懦…
You conniving, craven. . .

200
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,490
-希芙 希芙 -可悲之极的蠕虫
-Sif. Sif.  -. . . pathetic worm.

201
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,740
求求你了 别再来了 拜托 求求你了
Please, please, no more.  Please, I beg you.

202
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,906
我是个坏人 我知道 我真的是个坏人
I'm a horrible person.  I get it. I really am.

203
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,916
我剪了你的头发 因为我觉得好玩
I cut off your hair because I thought it'd be funny.

204
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,041
其实一点也不好玩
And it's not.

205
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,750
Uh. . .

206
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,291
我渴望别人的关注
I crave attention. . .

207
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,083
因为我是…
because I'm. . .

208
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,875
我是个…我是个自恋狂
I'm a. . . I'm a narcissist.

209
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,916
我觉得…
And I suppose it's. . .

210
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,333
这是因为我害怕孤独
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

211
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:22,375
你就是孤独一人 永远如此
You are alone and you always will be.

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,458
好吧 洛基
Okay, Loki.

213
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,083
能聊聊了吗？
You ready to talk?

214
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,875
花里胡哨的技术
Fancy technology.

215
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,281
威胁式的审讯策略
Threatening interrogation tactics.

216
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,031
感觉好像是昨日重现啊
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

217
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,115
自从上次以后发生了很多事啊
Well, there's been a lot of water under the bridge since then.

218
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,198
当然了
LOKI: Certainly has.

219
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,698
你说时间变异管理局在欺骗我 你接着说
Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me.  Go ahead.

220
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,615
还是说那就是蟑螂的求生本能？
Or is that just a cockroach's survival mechanism kicking in?

221
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,365
让我从这出去 别再对我动手 我就告诉你
Let me out of this place,  stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.

222
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,948
果然是蟑螂 明白了
Cockroach. Got it.

223
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,406
你为那个时间犯工作多久了？
How long have you been working for the Variant?

224
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,823
我？为她工作？拜托
Me? Working for her? Please.

225
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:27,365
如果你不是为她工作 那你们是什么？ 搭档吗？
If you're not working for the Variant,  what is it? You're partners?

226
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,708
当然不是
Absolutely not.

227
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,531
她很难伺候 让人头疼
She's difficult and irritating,

228
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,666
而且她一直在打我
and she tries to hit me all the time.

229
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,448
肯定不是搭档 不是
No. Not partners, no.

230
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,448
我也觉得你不该有搭档
Yeah, I guess you don't do partners.

231
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,406
当然 除非对你有好处
Unless, of course, it benefits you,

232
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,781
然后你计划在某一刻背叛他们
and you intend to betray them at some point.

233
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,198
这是达到目的的手段 莫比乌斯
It was a means to an end, Mobius.

234
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,906
欢迎来到现实世界
Welcome to the real world.

235
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,323
现实里 我们为了达到目的不择手段
Down there, we're awful to get what we want.

236
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,406
我用得着一个王子告诉我 现实世界是什么样的吗？
Now I gotta have a prince tell me how the real world works?

237
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,156
你给我讲讲 拉曼迪斯的关连事件是怎么回事
Why don't you just tell me what caused the nexus event on Lamentis?

238
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,365
我再说一遍
Let me say this again.

239
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,323
我不会告诉你的
I'm not going to tell you

240
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,865
不然你会立刻把我抛弃然后裁剪掉
just so you can turn around immediately afterwards and prune me.

241
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,948
咱这天儿是真往死了聊啊
I guess we've reached a dead end then.

242
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,073
好吧 到此为止
Okay, it's over.

243
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,615
我会怀念咱们拌嘴的时候的
I'm going to miss these little tete-a-tetes.

244
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,615
我也一样
LOKI: Me, too.

245
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,656
你是玩跳棋的 老莫比乌斯可是下象棋的
One guy playing checkers, you,  old Mobius playing chess,

246
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:23,406
替我问希芙女士好
but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.

247
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,198
什么…不 什么？不
What. . . No. What? No, no, no.

248
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:30,083
拜托 别…好吧 你等等 等等
Please, not. . .  Well, just wait, wait, wait.

249
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,208
怎么着？
Yeah?

250
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:38,416
当然是我在操控这一切
Of course it was me pulling the strings all along.

251
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:43,823
她很久以前来阿斯加德找我
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago

252
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,948
然后她带我去了其中一个末日
and then she took me to one of her apocalypses

253
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:51,323
在那里我们一起制定了计划
and that's where we hatched our plan together.

254
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,406
计划是？
Which is?

255
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,698
计划进展得很顺利 谢谢
Coming along very nicely, thank you.

256
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,031
那个时间犯呢？
MOBIUS: And the Variant?

257
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,000
不重要 她就是个棋子
Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.

258
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,073
有一件超级大的事要发生了
Something very, very big is gonna happen.

259
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,073
到那个时候 我就会抛弃她
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.

260
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,906
那用不着你自己动手了
Well, we saved you the trouble there.

261
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,531
她已经被裁剪了
She's already been pruned.

262
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,406
-假设我真的放了你 -等等
-So assume I do set you free.  -Hang on, wait.

263
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,073
-你刚才说什么？ -什么？假设我真的放了你
-What'd you just say?  -What? Assume I do set you free.

264
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,198
那个时间犯 她死了？
LOKI: The Variant. She's gone?

265
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,615
是的 她杀了我们两个人
Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours.

266
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,365
她本来要被送进时间监狱的 然后她挣脱了
Yeah, she was going to her Time Cell, broke free.

267
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,823
追捕者B-15出手裁剪了她
Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her.

268
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,573
你应该给追捕者B-15写个感谢信
So you might want to fire off a thank you note to Hunter B-15,

269
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,990
因为看来你才是更高级的洛基
because it looks like you're the superior Loki.

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,708
我本来是在她身上下注的 但是赛马就是这样
I would've bet on her,  but that's what makes a horse race.

271
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,708
总算摆脱了
Good riddance.

272
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,073
-有什么好笑的？ -不是吧
-What's so funny?  -Come on.

273
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,865
看看你的眼睛 你喜欢她
Look at your eyes. You like her.

274
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,990
-什么？ -你喜欢她 她喜欢你吗？
-What?  -You like her. Does she like you?

275
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
-她被裁剪了吗？ -怪不得你对
-LOKI: Was she pruned?  -No wonder you have no clue

276
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,948
拉曼迪斯的关连事件一点头绪都没有
what caused the nexus event on Lamentis.

277
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,948
你们两个人在互相爱慕
Both of you are swooning over each other.

278
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,781
-跟我说实话 -那可是末日
-LOKI: Tell me the truth.  -It's the apocalypse.

279
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,573
相同本体的两个时间犯
Two Variants of the same being,

280
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:18,531
特别是你 居然会有这种 病态的、扭曲的浪漫关系
especially you, forming this kind of sick,  twisted romantic relationship.

281
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,448
这太混乱了 这会打破现实
That's pure chaos.  That could break reality.

282
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,615
我的现实已经碎了一地了
It's breaking my reality right now.

283
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,615
真是惊天地泣鬼神的自恋狂
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

284
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,365
你爱上你自己了
You fell for yourself.

285
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,531
她叫希尔维
Her name was Sylvie.

286
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,240
希尔维
Ah, Sylvie.

287
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,323
挺好
Lovely.

288
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,198
怎么拼？是IE结尾还是I结尾？
How do you spell that?  Is that with an I-E or just an I?

289
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,500
她还活着吗？
Is she alive?

290
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,875
暂时吧
For now.

291
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,698
渗透时间变异管理局 一直都是你们的计划吗？
And was infiltrating the TVA,  was that always sort of the grand plan?

292
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,448
我们的利益是一致的
Our interests are aligned.

293
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,656
-推翻时间守护者？ -也许他们就应该被推翻
-MOBIUS: Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?  -Maybe they need to be overthrown.

294
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,990
-我应该抽你一耳光 -莫比乌斯 听着
-I ought to box your ears.  -LOKI: Mobius, listen.

295
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,115
如果希尔维说的是真的 这个地方在影响我们所有人
If what Sylvie told me about this place is true, it affects all of us.

296
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:07,115
开始了 你在过去10分钟里 已经说了50个谎了
Here we go. Now, you've already told me about 50 lies in the past 10 minutes.

297
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,573
-我没有说谎 -我觉得你现在就在说谎
-I'm not lying.  -Now, I'm supposed

298
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,781
-让我相信你的女朋友 -这是事实
-to believe your girlfriend.  -It's the truth.

299
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,531
-她不是我的女朋友 -你愿意叫她什么随你便
-She's not my girlfriend.  -Whatever you want to call her.

300
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,281
那个你如痴如狂一见倾心的女性自我
What, your female self that you have some demented crush on. . .

301
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,615
你们都是时间犯
You're all Variants!

302
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,990
所有在时间变异管理局工作的人都是
Everyone who works at the TVA.

303
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,990
时间守护者并没有创造你们 他们把你们从时间线上绑架了
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.  They kidnapped you from the timeline,

304
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
然后消除了你们的记忆
and erased your memories.

305
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,125
她可以通过附身进入那些记忆
Memories she can access through enchantment.

306
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:41,791
所以在这一切以前 你有自己的过往 也许你有自己的家庭 自己的生活
So before this, you had a past,  maybe you had a family, a life.

307
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,875
说的不错
Nice try.

308
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,031
真漂亮 你们俩还真是天生一对
That was good. You two, what a pair!

309
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,573
天啊 令人难以置信 你们所到之处 只有死亡和毁灭
Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go,  it's just death, destruction,

310
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,115
货真价实的世界末日
the literal ends of worlds.

311
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,865
我要结束这个案子了
Well, I'm gonna have to close this case now,

312
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,031
因为我不需要你了
'cause I don't need you anymore.

313
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,125
或者用你的说法 咱们的利益不一致了
Yeah, or as you might say,  our interests are no longer aligned.

314
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,656
你知道吗 这个地方所有的骗子里
You know, of all the liars in this place,

315
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,698
这里的骗子可不少 你是最大的骗子
and there are a great many,  you're the biggest.

316
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,240
为什么？因为我骗你女朋友死了？
Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?

317
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,541
不是 那个我心存感激 我是说你对自己的欺骗
Oh, no. That I can respect.  I mean, the lies you tell yourself.

318
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:56,625
一网打尽？ 删除以确认

319
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,250
开门
Open the door.

320
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,240
你好 我不知道你叫什么
Hello. . . Oh, I don't know.

321
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,833
你的名字是个数字 我在这边看不清
Your name's a number.  Can't read it from here.

322
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,416
跟我来
Come with me.

323
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,740
莫比乌斯？
Mobius?

324
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,740
好吧
Oh, yeah.

325
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,000
-你还好吗？ -我挺好的
-You okay?  -Yep, I'm good.

326
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,583
-结案了 -是的
-Case closed.  -Yes.

327
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,823
干杯
Cheers.

328
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,708
-干杯 -别再为这些事烦心了
-Cheers.  -To putting all this behind us.

329
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,125
阿门
Amen.

330
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:20,406
随便让你选 你会去什么时间什么地方？
If you could go anywhere, anytime,  where would it be?

331
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,365
我可以去任何地方任何时间
I can go anywhere, anytime.

332
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,708
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

333
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,250
为什么不让我审讯希尔维？
Why wouldn't you let me interrogate Sylvie?

334
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,615
-希尔维？ -那个时间犯 洛基这么称呼她
-Sylvie?  -The Variant, that's what Loki calls her.

335
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,573
为什么你不让我审问她？
Why wouldn't you let me,  you know, question her?

336
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,906
我告诉过你 不能冒险让她再跑掉
I told you,  we couldn't risk her escaping again.

337
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,156
她跑不掉的
She wouldn't have escaped.

338
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,833
另一个时间犯 在你第一次审问的时候就跑了 是不是？
The other Variant got away during your first interrogation, didn't he?

339
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:53,166
来吧 时间线上的任意时间地点 你去哪？
Come on. Anywhere and anytime on the timeline. Where'd you go?

340
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,490
我就想在这里陪着你一起工作
I like being here now, with you,  doing the work.

341
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,875
好吧
Fine.

342
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,031
我得到了时间守护者的命令
I received word from the Time-Keepers.

343
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,948
他们要亲眼看着这个时间犯被裁剪
They want to personally oversee the Variant's pruning.

344
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:13,375
他们要求你也在场
And they want you there, too.

345
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,958
终于等到这一刻了 太棒了
It's about time. Great.

346
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:24,458
你第一次注意到C-20有问题是什么时候？
When. . . When did you first notice what was going on with C-20?

347
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,490
莫比乌斯 你怎么了？
Mobius, what is going on with you?

348
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,573
-没怎么 -我们成功了
-Nothing.  -We did it.

349
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,198
-我知道 -时间守护者很高兴
-I know.  -The Time-Keepers are happy.

350
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,781
-太棒了 -任务完成了
-It's great.  -Mission accomplished.

351
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:35,865
任务完成了 只是她看上去挺好的…
Mission accomplished.  It was just that she seemed fine when I. . .

352
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,240
我看见她的时候 她有点恐惧 不过还好
When I saw her.  I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

353
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,990
她很快就不好了
Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

354
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,625
-好吧 -好吧
-Okay.  -Okay.

355
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,740
C-20？那个时间犯？
C-20? The Variant?

356
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,865
你问这些问题 到底想说什么？
All these questions,  what are you getting at?

357
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,448
我不知道…
I don't know. I. . .

358
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,041
感觉有些不对劲
Something just seems a little off.

359
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,500
好吧 你想知道真相吗？
Fine. You want the truth?

360
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,708
我在试着保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

361
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,781
正常情况下你会这样和人交谈吗？没问题
Would you normally interview someone like that? Yeah.

362
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,698
但是这个时间犯让我很害怕
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,

363
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,823
我可不想看到你出什么问题
and I didn't want to see anything happen to you.

364
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,490
C-20完全疯了
C-20 lost her mind.

365
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,406
她到最后连一句话都说不出来
She couldn't even form words by the end.

366
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:21,166
我可不能接受这样的事 发生在你或其他人身上
I just couldn't deal with that happening to you or anyone else.

367
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,166
这是你想知道的吗？
Is that what you wanted to hear?

368
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,406
是的 如果是事实的话
Yeah, if it's the truth.

369
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,781
你在这些洛基身上花了太多时间了
You've been spending too much time with Lokis.

370
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,198
是的
Yeah.

371
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,948
我确实在这些洛基身上花了太多时间了
I definitely have been spending too much time with Lokis.

372
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:35,115
咱们在这里的工作很重要
What we do here matters.

373
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,490
我知道
I know.

374
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,906
我们在为神圣时间线战斗的同时
When we're out there fighting for the fate of the Sacred Timeline

375
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:44,041
我们也在为我们自己而战
we're also fighting for this. For us.

376
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,416
我们是经历时间考验的战友 我们是永恒的盟友
Friends against time, allies to the end.

377
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:54,375
你和我一样 看到过所有的一切 所以你知道的
You've seen all of existence, same as me.  So, you know,

378
00:27:55,041 --> 00:28:00,166
像我们这样的友谊并不常见
friendship like ours is uncommon.

379
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,583
也值得我们为之奋斗
And worth fighting for.

380
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,791
神圣时间线也是如此
Same as the Sacred Timeline.

381
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,281
说得好
It was a good speech.

382
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,448
谢谢
Thank you.

383
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:20,240
我知道我是你最喜欢的分析师 承认这一点有那么难吗？
I knew I was your favorite analyst.  Was that so hard to admit?

384
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,865
你打算怎么处理那个战利品？ 要摆在哪里？
What are you gonna do with that trophy?

385
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:26,041
你说得对
-Oh!  -Where's that gonna go? You're right.

386
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,416
我想想
Let's see.

387
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,458
RAVONNA: Uh. . .

388
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,281
放在这怎么样？
How's that?

389
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:47,166
完美 你都快没地方放了
Looks perfect.  You're running out of room there.

390
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,073
好吧 回头见
All right, I will see you later on.

391
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,823
喝一杯就走了？
One drink?

392
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,115
-我喝了两杯 不是吗？ -莫比乌斯
-MOBIUS: I had two, didn't I?  -Mobius!

393
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:59,031
这可是你职业进阶的大好机会 你确定你没事吗？
This is a career case.  You sure you're okay?

394
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,291
我就是累了 对付这些洛基太累了
I'm just exhausted,  dealing with all these Lokis.

395
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,291
好吧
Fair enough.

396
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,323
咱们把这件事做个了断
Let's finish this.

397
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,948
永恒
For all time.

398
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,156
常相伴
Always.

399
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:16,833
咱们回头见 谢谢你的酒
I'll see you up there.  Thanks for the drink.

400
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,531
好吧 你想要公平决斗 我尊重你
Fine. You wanted a fair fight.  I respect that.

401
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,615
罗克斯卡特

402
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:33,875
你在我脑子里的时候 我看到了些东西
When you were in my head, I saw something.

403
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,000
你对我做了什么？
What did you do to me?

404
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,698
我让你看到了来时间变异管理局之前的人生
I showed you your life before the TVA.

405
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,365
那是骗人的 那不是真的
That's a trick. It's a deception.

406
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,240
-不 那是真的 -我是时间守护者创造的
-No, it's not.  -I was created by the Time-Keepers.

407
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,990
不是 我不能创造记忆
No. I can't create memories.

408
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,990
我只能利用已经存在的记忆
I can only use what's already there.

409
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,916
时间守护者夺走了你们的人生
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

410
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,791
夺走了你们所有人的人生
From all of you.

411
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,958
你们都是时间犯
You're Variants.

412
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,541
咱们是一样的
We're the same.

413
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,958
让我看看
Show me.

414
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,625
我看上去很快乐
I looked happy.

415
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,666
现在怎么办？
What now?

416
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:17,083
正在搜索

417
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:24,208
追捕者C-20 状况：已死亡

418
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,240
发现档案…任务简报 44Y10 已加密

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,365
黑文山 阿拉巴马州 罗克斯卡特

420
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,698
你没听我说话 我在那里
You're not hearing me. I was there.

421
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:41,333
我看到的是真的 这是我去过的地方
This was real, what I saw.  This is a place that I've been.

422
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:45,291
这不是时间变异管理局 这是我的记忆
This wasn't the TVA. This was a memory.

423
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:49,115
我住在那里 我去过那个酒吧 我有朋友
I lived down there. I went to that bar.  I had friends.

424
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,740
我在神圣时间线上有自己的人生
I had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline.

425
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,990
-冷静一下 -〝冷静一下〞？我是个时间犯
-INTERROGATOR: Calm down.  -"Calm down"? I'm a Variant.

426
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,990
你也一样 这里的所有人都一样
So are you.  So is every single person in this place.

427
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,250
我要结束这一切
I'm ending this.

428
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,490
我听过了 我听过一千遍了
I've heard it once,  I've heard it a thousand times.

429
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,875
〝你 你这个狼狈为奸、胆小怯懦 可悲之极的蠕虫 这是你干的〞
"You. You conniving, craven,  pathetic worm. You did this. "

430
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,240
对吗？
Right?

431
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,031
-你在干什么？ -消耗时间
-What are you doing?  -Passing the time.

432
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:28,240
你关心她吗？
Do you care about her?

433
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,281
希尔维？我不确定这个词用得是否准确
Sylvie? I'm not sure if it's the right word.

434
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,031
-咱们刚才已经聊过这个了 -住口
-We've covered this back in there.  -Shut up!

435
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,906
你真的觉得你就活该一个人吗？
Do you really think you deserve to be alone?

436
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:38,031
-洛基 -你让我住口的
-Loki!  -You told me to shut up.

437
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,823
你真的觉得你就活该一个人吗？
Do you believe you deserve to be alone?

438
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,031
-我不知道 -你最好快点想清楚
-I don't know.  -You better figure it out quick,

439
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,156
因为你们两个造成的关连事件
because the nexus event the two of you caused,

440
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:47,073
不管是什么关系 会让这个地方崩溃
whatever that connection is,  can bring this whole place down.

441
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,531
-所以咱们最好明白… -〝咱们〞？
-So we better understand. . .  -"We"?

442
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:52,740
你发誓她没有给追捕者C-20植入那些记忆？
Do you swear she didn't implant those memories in Hunter C-20?

443
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,333
莫比乌斯 不可能 我相信她
Mobius, no. I believe her.

444
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,791
所以我得相信两个洛基说的话？
So, I just have to trust the word of two Lokis?

445
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,125
你觉得相信朋友说的话怎么样？
How about the word of a friend?

446
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:11,990
关于时间变异管理局 你是对的
You were right, about the TVA.

447
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,906
你从一开始就是对的
You were right from the beginning.

448
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,531
如果你想要救她 就得相信我
And if you wanna save her,  you need to trust me.

449
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,791
可以吗？
Can we do that?

450
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,031
-可以 -好的
-Yes.  -MOBIUS: Okay.

451
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:26,073
你可以成为任何你想成为的人
You could be whoever,  whatever you wanna be,

452
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,458
甚至是个好人
even someone good.

453
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:33,250
我的意思是 没准曾经有人让你做个坏人呢
I mean, just in case anyone ever told you different.

454
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,240
我觉得你拿了我的东西
I think you have something of mine.

455
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,291
对 我大老远跑到这里 才发现我拿错了
Yeah, I got all the way down there before I even realized I picked up yours.

456
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,166
怎么了？
What's going on?

457
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,333
有什么问题 拉芙娜？
What's the problem, Ravonna?

458
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,791
你知道让我选 我想去哪里吗？
You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere?

459
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,448
我要去我真正来自的地方
Wherever it is I'm really from.

460
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:19,031
对 在时间变异管理局之前我生活的地方
Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.

461
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,708
没准我有个摩托艇呢
Maybe I had a jet ski.

462
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,656
那就是我想做的
That's what I'd like to do.

463
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:27,000
-到处骑摩托艇 -裁剪掉他
-Just riding around on my jet ski.  -Prune him.

464
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,166
在电梯那里等着我
Wait for me at the elevator.

465
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,490
刚才谁和她在一起？
Who was in here with her?

466
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,041
抱歉 长官 B-15坚持要进来
Sorry, ma'am, B-15 insisted.

467
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,281
发出警报 抓住追捕者B-15
Put out an alert for Hunter B-15.

468
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:39,041
她也被时间犯策反了
She too has been compromised by the Variant.

469
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,500
你还好吗？
You okay?

470
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,500
接下来他们两个交给我了
I've got them from here.

471
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,541
你记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

472
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,375
我记得
I do.

473
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,125
你想对我说什么 时间犯？
What do you wanna say to me, Variant?

474
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,948
我的关连事件是什么？
What was my nexus event?

475
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,625
你为什么把我带来？
Why did you bring me in?

476
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,208
这重要吗？
What does it matter?

477
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:57,208
夺走我的人生 导致所有这一切
It was enough to take my life from me,  lead to all of this.

478
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,073
肯定很重要
Must have been important.

479
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,166
所以 是什么？
So, what was it?

480
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,833
我不记得了
I don't remember.

481
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,823
仁慈的时间守护者
RAVONNA: Gracious Time-Keepers,

482
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:39,083
如我承诺的那样 我带来了时间犯
as promised, the Variants.

483
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,990
经历了几番波折后
After all your struggle,

484
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,990
你们终于站在了我们面前
at last, you've arrived before us.

485
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,490
在你们迎来结局之前 有什么要说的吗 时间犯？
What do you have to say for yourselves before you meet your end, Variants?

486
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,291
这就是你们把我们带到这里的原因吗？
Is that the only reason you brought us here?

487
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:58,750
杀了我们？
To kill us?

488
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,823
我已经记不清我被杀过多少次了 所以请便
I've lost track of the number of times I've been killed, so go ahead.

489
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,448
动手吧
Do your worst.

490
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:10,740
你的虚张声势对我们毫无威胁 时间犯
You and your bravado are no threat to us, Variant.

491
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,531
不 我觉得你们不是这么想的
Oh, no, I don't think you believe that.

492
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,916
我觉得…
-I think. . .  -

493
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,531
我觉得你们很恐惧
I think you're scared.

494
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:26,573
不 时间犯 你太令人失望了
No, Variant. You're nothing but a cosmic disappointment.

495
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,875
-删除掉他们 -不 我还没说完呢
-Delete them.  -No, I'm not done with you yet.

496
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,750
永恒
For all time.

497
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,166
常相伴
Always.

498
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,166
保护时间守护者
Protect the Time-Keepers!

499
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,333
帮我个忙？
LOKI: A little help here?

500
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,375
接着
Here.

501
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,958
来啊
Come on.

502
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:27,916
这一次我来做个了断
This time I finish the job.

503
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,531
你也是时间守护者的子嗣 希尔维
You're a child of the Time-Keepers too, Sylvie.

504
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,708
-我们可以谈谈 -好啊？
-We can talk.  -SYLVIE: Oh, yeah?

505
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,625
等等
Wait.

506
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,833
不要
Don't.

507
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:33,916
假的
Fake.

508
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,625
没有灵魂的机器人
Mindless androids.

509
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,541
它永远不会停止
It never stops.

510
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:54,365
那是谁创造了时间变异管理局？
Then who created the TVA?

511
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,750
我原以为这就是终点了
I thought this was it.

512
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,208
希尔维…
Sylvie. . .

513
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:17,698
不用安慰我了
Not another pep talk, please.

514
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:22,041
不 我有些事要告诉你
No, I have to tell you something.

515
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,823
我们会弄明白的
We will figure this out.

516
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,041
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

517
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,416
因为…
Because, uh. . .

518
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,416
在拉曼迪斯的时候
Well, back on Lamentis. . .

519
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,416
我从来没有经历过
This is new for me. Um. . .

520
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,333
什么？
What?

521
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,166
你要干什么？
What is it?

522
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,740
动手吧
Do it.

523
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,573
不
No.

524
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:17,625
你要把一切都告诉我
You're gonna tell me everything.

525
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,281
If the sun

526
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,906
Should tumble from the sky

527
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,125
If the sea

528
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
根据漫威漫画改编
Should suddenly run dry

529
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:43,198
If you love me

530
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:46,240
Really love me

531
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,416
Let it happen

532
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:53,698
I won't care

533
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:55,948
If it seems

534
00:42:55,958 --> 00:43:00,375
That everything is lost

535
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,156
I will smile

536
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:08,198
And never count the cost

537
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:12,656
If you love me

538
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,740
Really love me

539
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,198
Let it happen

540
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:22,990
Darling, I

541
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,781
Won't care

542
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:30,656
Shall I catch a shooting star?

543
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:34,448
Shall I bring it where you are?

544
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:39,375
If you want me to, I will

545
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:45,198
You can set me any task

546
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,906
I'll do anything you ask

547
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:55,500
If you'll only say you love me still

548
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,115
When at last

549
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:03,948
Our life on earth is through

550
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:06,198
I will share

551
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:11,125
Eternity with you

552
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:15,406
If you love me

553
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:18,406
Really love me

554
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:21,583
Let it happen

555
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,573
I won't care

556
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,948
漫威影业出品
I you love me

557
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:36,115
《洛基》
Really love me

558
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:36,115
Let it happen

559
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:40,791
Darling, I. . .

560
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,583
这是赫尔海姆吗？
Is this Hel?

561
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,781
我死了吗？
Am I dead?

562
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,958
还没有
VOICE: Not yet.

563
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,833
但你要是不跟我们走 就死定了
But you will be unless you come with us.
