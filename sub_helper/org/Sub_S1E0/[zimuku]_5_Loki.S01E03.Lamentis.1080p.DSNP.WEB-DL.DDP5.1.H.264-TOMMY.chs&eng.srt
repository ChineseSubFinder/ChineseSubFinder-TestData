1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,156
这里是全宇宙最强大的力量吗？
101 Is this the greatest power in the universe?

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,281
前情提要

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,791
一个在逃的时间犯在杀害我们的时间卫士
MOBIUS: A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:16,740
不管这个时间犯是谁 我们一直找不到他
Whoever this Variant is,  we haven't been able to find him.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,781
时间变异管理局和阿斯加德的众神 是一路货色
LOKI: The Time Variance Authority and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,823
醉心于权力 却无视真相
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:26,073
时间守护者监控着这个案件的每个环节
The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case.

8
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,000
他藏在末日里
He's hiding in apocalypses.

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,490
所以你就是时间变异管理局找来 追捕我的那个笨蛋
HUNTER B-15: You're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,323
应该是我吧
Me, I presume.

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,156
我要推翻时间守护者
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:40,041
我对统治时间变异管理局毫无兴趣
I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,240
我说出去了
HUNTER C-20: I gave it away.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,906
时间守护者 他们的位置
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,041
你想干什么？
What do you want?

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,948
不要 洛基 等等
MOBIUS: No! No! Loki, wait!

17
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,240
等等 洛基 等等
Wait! Loki, wait!

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,666
不要 等等 洛基
No! Wait, Loki!

19
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,281
咱们可以点烤土豆或炸鸡柳
We could do potato skins or buffalo fingers. . .

20
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,990
也可以去别的地方吃
Or we could eat somewhere else.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,448
你为什么讨厌这个地方？
Why do you hate this place?

22
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,240
不是讨厌 是有点害怕
I don't hate it, I fear it.

23
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,448
你知道卫生部门
Do you know how many times

24
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,031
让这里停业了多少次吗？
the health department has closed this place down?

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,500
饮料看着还行
Well, the drinks seem fine. Mmm. . .

26
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,156
天啊
- -Oh, God!

27
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,240
冻彻心扉啊
Ah, brain freeze!

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,156
你知道什么叫冻彻心扉吧？
You know what brain freeze is, don't you?

29
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,240
我来告诉你
Here we go.

30
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,573
就是当你吸了一口特别凉的饮料
It's when you sip something so cold. . .

31
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,198
整个人就像冻住了一样. . .  我知道了
Brain freeze associated with coldness. . .  Got it.

32
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,281
别插嘴 我说正经的
Wait, I'm being serious.

33
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:14,323
冰水从上腭渗透进去 然后冻住了你的心智
So, it permeates the roof of your mouth and it freezes the synapses in your brain.

34
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:18,833
所以你的记忆也被冻结了
So, your memories are literally frozen in place.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,740
-绝对不可能 -真的是这样
-That is absolutely not true.  -It is!

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,406
好吧 那做个实验 你在想的事会被冻住
Okay. Try it. Whatever you're thinking about will get frozen in place.

37
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,781
我要问你一个问题
I'm gonna ask you a question,

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,365
在心智解冻之前 你回答不了
and you won't be able to answer until the synapses have melted.

39
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,583
放马过来
Challenge accepted.

40
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,240
好的 问吧
Okay, ask.

41
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,916
时间守护者身边有多少守卫？
How many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?

42
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,416
不好意思 你说什么？
I'm sorry, what?

43
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,458
咱们交朋友多长时间了？
Hey, how long have we been best friends?

44
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,740
很久了
Too long.

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,031
说真的 你什么都可以告诉我 是不是？
Seriously, you know you can tell me anything, right?

46
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,240
当然了
Of course.

47
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,406
那你告诉我时间守护者身边 有多少守卫？
Why won't you tell me how many people are guarding the Time-Keepers?

48
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,666
好吧 那里有. . .
Oh, well, there's. . .

49
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,125
这个地方 我. . .
This place, I. . .

50
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,291
我想起来了 我认识这里
I remember, I know this place.

51
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,531
但是我不认识你
But I don't know you.

52
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,708
没事的 你就是有点累了
It's okay. You're just tired.

53
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:26,125
对 我可能就是累了
Yeah. I'm probably just tired.

54
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,666
电梯在哪里？
How do I find the elevators?

55
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,125
电梯是金色的
HUNTER C-20: They're gold.

56
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:50,708
《洛基》

57
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,490
所有时间卫士立刻前往军械库
ANNOUNCER:  All Minutemen to armory.

58
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,000
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,156
所有时间卫士立刻前往军械库
All Minutemen to armory.

60
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,458
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,833
我不知道 先生
MINUTEMAN: I don't know, sir.

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,031
所有时间卫士立刻前往军械库
ANNOUNCER: All Minutemen to armory.

63
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,416
保护时间线
Protect the timeline.

64
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,083
站住
Hey! Stop!

65
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,031
我有几个问题
A few questions.

66
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,948
你没别的事可干了吗？
Have you got nothing else to do?

67
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,291
真粗鲁
Rude.

68
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,906
你确定你是洛基吗？
Are you sure you're a Loki?

69
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,666
-你挡着道了 -我要找的就是你
-You're in my way.  -You are my way.

70
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,000
我本来觉得咱们可以合作
I thought perhaps we could work together.

71
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,041
但是现在我觉得你缺乏远见
But now I see you lack vision.

72
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,458
所以 你愿意一起来也好
So, either you'll come willingly. . .

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,073
不愿意也好 无所谓 你都要带我去找时间守护者
Or you won't. Either way,  that's how I get to the Time-Keepers.

74
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,291
天啊 闭嘴
Oh, God. Shut up!

75
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,583
嘿
- -RENSLAYER: Hey!

76
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,781
敢过来我就杀了他
Come any closer and I'll kill him.

77
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,833
动手吧
-Go for it.  -

78
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,458
放开我的腿
Get off my leg!

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,615
再见 时间犯
Goodbye, Variant.

80
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,125
电量已耗尽
-MISS MINUTES: You're outta juice.  -

81
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,458
不能用了
It's not working.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,073
好吧. . .
-LOKI: Right. . .  -

83
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,740
把它给我 你不知道怎么充电
Give It To me.  You don't know how to Recharge it.

84
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,740
我当然知道 你又不是唯一的技术狂洛基
Of course I do.  You're not the only tech savvy Loki.

85
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,958
别那么叫我
Don't ever call me that.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,875
-科技狂？ -不 是洛基
-Tech savvy?  -No, a Loki.

87
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,406
看来你是个魔法师？
You're just fully a magician then?

88
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:29,333
好吧 我的下一招 就是要让你消失
Fine. For my next trick,  I'll make you disappear.

89
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,416
-那是你的能力吗？ -你把我们带去哪了？
-Is that one of your powers?  -Where did you send us?

90
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:49,041
拉曼迪斯一号卫星

91
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,583
2077年

92
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,115
你这个白痴 这是拉曼迪斯一号卫星
You idiot! This is Lamentis 1.

93
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,375
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what that means!

94
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,625
这颗卫星会和行星相撞然后毁灭
The moon that planet is about to crash into and destroy.

95
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,281
时间控制器储存的所有末日里 这是最糟糕的
Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!

96
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,115
没人能活下来
No one makes it off here!

97
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,156
小心
-Watch out!  -

98
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,208
对不起 女士 我没来得及看宣传册
I'm sorry, madam.  Didn't have time to scan the brochure.

99
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,615
不过我本以为你希望我死掉
By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.

100
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,365
我不知道你把时间控制器藏在哪了
I don't know where you hid that TemPad,

101
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,156
但是如果你完蛋了 它也会一起完蛋 然后我也就一起完蛋了
but if you blow up, it blows up,  and then I end up blown up.

102
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,781
那边
There!

103
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,791
-所以咱们现在是团队了？ -天啊 不要
-So we're a team now?  -Oh, God, no!

104
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,906
低头
-Get down!  -

105
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,365
我不需要你帮我
Didn't need your help!

106
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,833
你真奇怪
You're so weird!

107
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,365
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

108
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,365
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

109
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,916
你在试图附身我吗？
You trying to enchant me?

110
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,781
没用的
It won't work.

111
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,406
为什么？因为你是魔法师？
Why? Because you're a magician?

112
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:35,208
-不 因为我的心智太强大了 -好吧
-No, because my mind is too strong.  -Fine!

113
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,865
咱们真的现在要这样吗？再打一架？
Look. Are we really about to do this here? Again?

114
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,281
那你有什么建议？
What do you propose instead?

115
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,458
我不知道 停战？
I don't know. A truce?

116
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,281
听着 如果我们不能恢复时间控制器
LOKI: Listen, neither of us is getting off this rock

117
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,906
咱俩谁也别想离开这个鬼地方
if we can't turn that TemPad on.

118
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,406
你把它藏在哪了？
Where do you have it hidden?

119
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,656
-在我心里 -好吧 那我就把它挖出来
-In my heart.  -Well, then, I'll cut it out.

120
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,406
不错 真搞笑 太可爱了
Nice. Very droll. Lovely.

121
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,906
好吧 没错 时间控制器在我这
Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad,

122
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,990
要不是因为你一直要杀了我 我才不会走那么远
but I'm not gonna get very far if you keep trying to kill me.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,906
你不理智是因为你需要我来充电
You're full of it because you need me to get that recharged.

124
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,541
这就是你救我的唯一原因
That's the only reason you saved me out there.

125
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,073
也许吧
Maybe.

126
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,115
是的 没错 也是原因之一吧
Yeah. I mean, sure. That too.

127
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,406
或者咱们也可以在这个破矿场里自相残杀
Or we could slaughter each other here in this abandoned mining shack.

128
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,333
-你觉得呢？ -我没问题
-What do you say?  -Good for me.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,656
我谋划了这么多年 被你破坏了
The plan you interrupted was years in the making.

130
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,406
-那么多年 -好吧 知道了
-Years!  -Okay, got it.

131
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,656
只要我能打开时间控制器
And as soon as I turn that TemPad back on,

132
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,490
我就直接回到时间变异管理局 然后完成我该干的事
I'm going straight back to the TVA to finish what I started.

133
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,615
好
Good.

134
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,791
-到那时再杀掉你 -也许是我杀掉你
-I'll kill you then.  -Or I'll kill you.

135
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,740
你要去哪？
Where're you going?

136
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,698
这个卫星上应该有电源
There's power somewhere on this moon.

137
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,875
我们需要足够电量 在不同维度的时间和空间中穿行
We just need enough to travel through inter-dimensional time and space.

138
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,198
天啊
Jeez!

139
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,250
好
Yep.

140
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,031
那么计划是什么？
So, what's the plan?

141
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,490
那边附近有个小镇 你能闭嘴吗？
There's a town near here.  And can you shut up?

142
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,823
我不得不和你合作 但是我不想听见你的声音
Just because I have to work with you doesn't mean I wanna hear your voice.

143
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,531
好吧 那. . . 走慢点 时间犯
All right, well. . . Slow down, Variant.

144
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,906
你不知道咱们快死了吗？
What part of imminent death confuses you?

145
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,073
还有别叫我〝时间犯〞
And don't call me "Variant. "

146
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,198
对不起 但是我也不会对着一张 我自己的褪色的照片叫〝洛基〞
I'm sorry, but I'm not calling some faded photocopy of me "Loki. "

147
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:30,031
好啊 反正那也不再是我了 我现在叫希尔维
Good. 'Cause that's not who I am anymore.  I'm Sylvie now.

148
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,531
你换名字了 太好了
You changed your name. Brilliant.

149
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,615
这叫化名
It's called an alias.

150
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,781
听起来一点也不像洛基
It's not very Loki-like.

151
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:37,448
是吗？那洛基有什么特点吗？
Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?

152
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,031
独立、权威和有型
Independence, authority, style.

153
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,115
所以你就自然而然地 去给那些乏味专制的时间警察卖命了
SYLVIE: So, naturally you went to work for the boring, oppressive time police.

154
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,823
我没有给他们卖命 我只是个顾问而已
LOKI: I don't work for them.  I'm a consultant.

155
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,365
你根本不知道你想要什么
SYLVIE: You don't know what you want.

156
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,583
是吗？那你呢？
Oh, yeah? What about you?

157
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,240
你这么多年的谋划 就是为了毁掉那个地方
Your years-in-the-making plan was to tear the place down,

158
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,990
创造出终极的权力真空 然后默默走开
create the ultimate power vacuum,  and then just walk away.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,323
我可永远不会那么干
I'd never have done that.

160
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,083
是吗？好吧 我不是你
Yeah? Well, I'm not you.

161
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,958
咱们能继续走了吗？
Can we get on with this now?

162
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,448
好像所有人都跑了
LOKI: It looks like everyone already fled.

163
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,083
他们就算这么做了 也是白费力气
SYLVIE: If they did, it was in vain.

164
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,990
咱们还有多长时间？
LOKI: How long do we have?

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,990
12个小时左右 这里的情况只会越来越糟
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so.  Things down here are only gonna get worse.

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,698
更多的陨石 然后重力地震
More meteors, gravity quakes,

167
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:33,041
当然 还有毁灭前夕社会秩序的崩溃
and of course, the collapse of society in the face of annihilation.

168
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,781
那能给时间控制器充电吗？
Could that charge the TemPad?

169
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,791
也许吧
Maybe.

170
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,198
我看了连接器 连接没问题
I'm just checking the coupling.  Making sure it can connect.

171
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,156
好吧
Right.

172
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,541
好了 给我吧
Okay. Hand it over.

173
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:56,916
可惜 我不会给你的 你得再努力点
Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you.  You're gonna have to try harder.

174
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,865
你也别假装什么〝技术狂〞
Then don't give me your "tech savvy" ideas either.

175
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,833
时间控制器需要大量能源 夜灯可没用
The TemPad requires a massive power source, not a night light.

176
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:37,615
蛮力不能取代策略和诡计
Brute force is no substitute for diplomacy and guile.

177
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,791
知道了
Noted.

178
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,000
你能飞这么远真是可圈可点
It's remarkable that you ever made it as far as you did.

179
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,323
不好意思
Sorry about that.

180
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,740
没事 我挺爽的
Don't be. I enjoyed it.

181
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,823
我也是
Oh. . . I did too.

182
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,281
我向你保证
But I can assure you,

183
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,448
虽然我的朋友像个动物一样冲动
despite my acquaintance behaving like an animal. . .

184
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,156
我们没有恶意 我们只是疲惫的旅行者
. . . uh, we mean you no harm.  We're simply weary travelers.

185
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,250
好吧
Sure you are.

186
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
你好 亲爱的
MAN: Hello, dear.

187
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,041
帕屈斯？
Patrice?

188
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,958
过了这么久
It. . . It's been a long time.

189
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,375
你还是那么美…
You're as beautiful as. . .

190
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:49,000
帕屈斯过去三十年一句好听的话都没说过
WOMAN: Patrice never said a thing that nice in 30 years.

191
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,333
你们根本不是旅行者 你们是魔鬼
You're no travelers, you're devils.

192
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,698
这算哪个？策略？
Which one was that? Diplomacy?

193
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,291
别说了
-Or. . .  -Don't. Just don't.

194
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,740
你们这些魔鬼想干什么？
What do you devils want with me?

195
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,208
我们就是想问一下 人都去哪了？
We just wanna ask you a question.  Where is everyone?

196
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,375
方舟号
The ark.

197
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,375
逃生船
The evacuation vessel.

198
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:22,833
那里肯定有足够能源给时间控制器充电
Something like that would have enough juice to repower the TemPad.

199
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,375
我们怎么去？
How do we get there?

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,833
火车站在小镇边上 但是你们不可能有票
Train station's the edge of town.  But you'll never get a ticket.

201
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,458
走吧
Come on, let's go.

202
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,541
安静
GUARD: Quiet down!

203
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,823
后退
Get back!

204
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,656
怎么回事？
What's going on?

205
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:06,323
方舟号今晚出发 我们已经排了好几个小时的队了
The ark leaves tonight and we've been waiting in line for hours.

206
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,750
好几个小时
For hours.

207
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,740
这有点意思
Well, this looks fun.

208
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,281
来吧
Come on.

209
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,073
我们不能靠打架上火车
We can't fight our way onto that train.

210
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,615
谁说要打架了？
Who said anything about fighting?

211
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,990
-你的计划里都是打架 -这个不是
-All your plans involve fighting.  -Not this one.

212
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,490
我要去附身一个守卫 让他带我们穿过人群
I'm going to enchant a guard,  have him lead us through the crowd,

213
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,615
要是有人找麻烦. . .
and if anyone gives us any trouble. . .

214
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,156
就让他开枪？
Make him start shooting?

215
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,073
然后呢 杀掉所有守卫劫持火车？
And then what, kill every guard and hijack the train?

216
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,531
要不要打架就全看他们了
Whether or not there's a fight is entirely up to them.

217
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,583
咱们按我的办法来吧
We're doing this one my way.

218
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,615
-看上去怎么样？ -看上去是个很烂的计划
-How do I look?  -Like someone with a shit plan.

219
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,615
这计划可棒了
-It's a great plan.  -Hmm.

220
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,250
跟我来
Just follow my lead.

221
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,448
-为什么我们不能上车？ -让我们进去 快点
WOMAN: Why can't we get on?  MAN: Let us in! Come on!

222
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,323
去苏鲁？这边请 先生
GUARD: To Shuroo? This way, sir.

223
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,916
让我们进去 妇女和儿童. . .
MAN 2: Let us in! Women and children. . .

224
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,365
他们只把票给了有钱人
They're only giving tickets out to the wealthy!

225
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,333
那咱们呢？
What about us?

226
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,458
您的票？
GUARD: Tickets?

227
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,906
嘿
Whoa! Hey!

228
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,573
我要把她带去苏鲁
Taking this one to Shuroo.

229
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,615
好的 票呢？
Okay. And the tickets?

230
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,323
上面有命令 带她上车
Orders come from the top to get her on this train.

231
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,833
长官 这个. . .
Sir, this. . .

232
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,198
有事吗？
Everything okay?

233
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,615
一切正常
Yeah, everything's fine.

234
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,698
对 我想起来了 总部今天早上
Yeah, I just remembered that headquarters radioed in

235
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,666
来电发出命令
their request for them this morning.

236
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,000
好的
Okay.

237
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,250
好的
Okay.

238
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,333
您的票？
GUARD: Tickets?

239
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,708
晚上好 乘客们 你们好
Good evening, passengers. Hi.

240
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,281
我不能在火车上反方向坐
Um, uh, look,  I can't go backwards on a train.

241
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,198
我从来不背对着门
Well, I never sit with my back to a door.

242
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,781
什么意思？两边都有门啊
What? There are doors on both sides.

243
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,416
赶紧坐下吧
Oh, just sit down.

244
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,448
注意 这根本不是计划
FYI, that wasn't even a plan.

245
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,531
真的吗？
Oh, really?

246
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,115
计划有很多步骤
Plans have multiple steps.

247
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,375
打扮成守卫上火车就是个动作而已
Dressing as a guard and getting on a train is just doing a thing.

248
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,791
你累了吗？你可以休息一下
Oh, you a bit tired?  Feel free to, you know, get some rest.

249
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,365
我不能在这种地方睡觉
I can't sleep in a place like this.

250
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,781
你在火车上睡不着觉？
You can't sleep on a train?

251
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,656
不是 身边都是不能信任的人 我不能睡
No. I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.

252
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,281
好吧 你是说我吗？
Oh, right. That me?

253
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,573
但是你可以小睡一下
But you feel free to take a nap.

254
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,948
你真聪明
Nice try.

255
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,781
我不会浪费时间寻找时间控制器
I'm not gonna waste my time rooting around for the TemPad

256
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,490
当有人教你正式的魔法的时候
when someone taught you fairly decent magic.

257
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
我的母亲
My mother.

258
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,625
她是什么样的人？
What was she like?

259
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,666
她是. . .
She was, um. . .

260
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,041
阿斯加德的皇后
A Queen of Asgard.

261
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,916
她人很好 非常高贵
She was good. Purely decent.

262
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,240
你确定她是你母亲吗？
Are you sure she was your mother?

263
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,240
不 其实她不是 我是领养的
Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted.

264
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,531
我是不是泄密了？不好意思啊
Is that a bit of a spoiler for you?  Sorry about that.

265
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,156
没事 我知道我是领养的
No, I knew I was adopted.

266
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,323
什么？他们告诉你了？
What? They told you?

267
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,625
-对 他们没告诉你吗？ -没有
-SYLVIE: Yeah. Did they not tell you?  -No.

268
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,448
当然 他们最后还是告诉我了
I mean, they did, eventually.

269
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:42,323
等等 给我讲讲你的母亲
Hang on a second.  So, tell. . . Tell me about your mother.

270
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,531
我几乎不记得她了
I barely remember her.

271
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,750
只有模模糊糊的印象
Just blips of a dream at this point.

272
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:58,250
我还小的时候 她会给我变这些小魔法
You know, when I was young, she'd do these little bits of magic for me.

273
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:05,250
比如把花朵变成青蛙 或者在水面上扔烟花
Like turn a flower into a frog or cast fireworks over the water.

274
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,823
看上去都是不可能的
It all seemed impossible.

275
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,375
她告诉我我也可以 因为. . .
She told me that I'd be able to do it too because. . .

276
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,875
因为我无所不能
Because I could do anything.

277
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,791
你想看看吗？
You wanna see?

278
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,500
还不错
Not bad.

279
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,115
她是那种能让你相信自己的人
She was the kinda person you'd want to believe in you.

280
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,541
看来她做到了
Sounds like she does.

281
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,291
她确实做到了
Well, she did.

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,906
你是在哪里学的. . .
So, where'd you learn to do the. . .

283
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,073
-就是那个. . . 那个什么？ -我自学的
-You know, the. . . Whatever it is?  -I taught myself.

284
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,458
-你自学的魔法？ -是的
-You taught yourself that magic?  -Yeah, I did.

285
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,615
那你就是. . .
What, do you just. . .

286
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,531
你就是进入他们的心智 然后投射了一些幻象？
You just go into their minds and project some sort of illusion?

287
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,948
这样会更简单 如果我. . .
It'd be easier if I just. . .

288
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,573
附身在我身上 拿走时间控制器 然后跳车？
Enchanted me and take the TemPad and leap out the train?

289
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,281
-不必了 谢谢 -那就别问了
-No, thank you.  -Well then, don't ask.

290
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,823
-好吧 -要香槟吗？
Okay.  -Champagne?

291
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,990
要 非常感谢
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

292
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,156
我不用了 谢谢
No, I'm good, thanks.

293
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,541
那她的给我吧 谢谢
Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you.

294
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,083
干杯
Cheers.

295
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,666
敬世界末日
To the end of the world.

296
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,656
那个老女人选择去死 太可惜了 你不觉得吗？
A pity the old woman chose to die,  don't you think?

297
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,573
-她恋爱了 -她恨他
-She was in love.  -She hated him.

298
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,041
也许爱就是恨
Maybe love is hate.

299
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,531
我应该记下来
Should probably remember that.

300
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,781
怎么说的？〝爱就是…〞
What was that? "Love is. . . "

301
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,875
-"爱就是恨" -去死吧
-"Love is hate. " -Oh, piss off!

302
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,323
那么 说到爱的问题
So, on the subject of love,

303
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:51,031
这场战斗的最后 有没有个幸运的家伙在等待着你？
is there a lucky beau waiting for you at the end of this crusade?

304
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,990
有啊 还真的有
-Yeah, there is, actually.  -Oh.

305
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,906
在我穿梭时空在末日间跑来跑去的时候
Managed to maintain quite a serious long-distance relationship with a postman

306
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,115
我一直在努力维持和一个邮差的异地恋
whilst running across time. . . - -. . . from one apocalypse to another.

307
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,073
这样的魅力 谁能抵抗？
With charm like that,  who could resist you?

308
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,448
面对毁灭 人们什么都愿意
Well, people are quite willing in the face of certain doom.

309
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,750
他们肯定是
I'm sure they are.

310
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,583
这就是我继续的动力
It was only ever just to keep me going.

311
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,240
你呢？你可是个王子
How about you? You're a prince.

312
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,583
对方肯定是个公主吧 或者没准是另一个王子
Must've been would-be-princesses or perhaps, another prince.

313
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,448
两者都有吧 我和你一样
A bit of both. I suspect the same as you.

314
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,198
但是 没有什么. . .
But, nothing ever. . .

315
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,375
是真的
Real.

316
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,875
Mmm. . .

317
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,750
那么爱就是欺骗
Love is mischief, then.

318
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,208
不
No.

319
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,416
爱就是. . .
Love is. . .

320
00:22:55,083 --> 00:23:00,166
我愿意再来杯酒继续思考的东西
uh, something I might have to have another drink to think about.

321
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,323
你知道我们要试图劫持能源吧
You do realize we're about to try and hijack

322
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,115
那可是这个文明唯一的希望
the power source to a civilization's only hope?

323
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,948
-我知道 -这可不简单
-I do.  -It's not gonna be easy.

324
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,198
咱们应该歇一下
We should rest.

325
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,833
好吧 你歇你的 我歇我的
All right. You relax your way and I'll relax mine.

326
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,823
她在歌唱 歌唱返乡
She sings, she sings come home

327
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,958
她在歌唱 歌唱返乡
When she sings, she sings come home

328
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,198
你的制服呢？
Where's your uniform?

329
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,615
她在歌唱 歌唱返乡 她在歌唱 歌唱返乡
When she sings, she sings come home When she sings, she sings come home

330
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:54,625
她在歌唱 歌唱返乡 她在歌唱 歌唱返乡
When she sings, she sings come home When she sings, she sings come home

331
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:40,740
她在歌唱 歌唱返乡 她在歌唱 歌唱返乡
When she sings, she sings come home When she sings, she sings come home

332
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,458
-敬希尔维 一起干杯 -太棒了
-To Sylvie, everybody!  -MAN: Yeah!

333
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,458
再来一杯
Another!  -

334
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,365
你喝醉了
You're drunk.

335
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,990
没有 我就是吃饱了
No, I'm just full.

336
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,615
但是记住 我非常饱
But bear in mind, I'm very full.

337
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,323
你来试试这个
Now, I need you to try this.

338
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,740
和波特酒特别搭
It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port.

339
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,198
谁有波特酒？
Who's got the Figgy Port?

340
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,156
关于波特酒你一定得相信我
You have to take my word on the Figgy Port.

341
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,448
你的制服呢？我们应该低调点
Where's your uniform?  We're meant to be laying low.

342
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,698
没人在乎 世界末日了
Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.

343
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,365
-我觉得有些问题 -没错
-I think something's happening.  -Yes.

344
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,198
那颗星星快撞上我们了
Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.

345
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:19,156
别犯傻了 我看见有些人奇怪地看着你
Don't be an ass.  I saw some people looking at you weirdly.

346
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,333
什么？
What?

347
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,198
你是什么时候变得这么偏执的？
When did you get so paranoid?

348
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,448
肯定是从我用毕生时间
It must have started when I spent my entire life

349
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,875
追踪你卖命的那些无所不知的独裁者开始的
running from the omniscient fascists you work for.

350
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,156
浪费了太可惜了
It's a shame to let that go to waste.

351
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:35,740
换个话题 我想到了个答案
Hey! Change of subject.  I thought of an answer.

352
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,865
什么答案？
To what?

353
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,291
你的问题
Your question.

354
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:45,791
爱就是一把匕首
Love is a dagger.

355
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:52,281
这把武器 可能远在天边 也可能近在咫尺
It's a weapon to be wielded far away or up close.

356
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,583
你能透过它看到你自己 多么美妙
You can see yourself in it.  It's beautiful.

357
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,666
直到它让你头破血流
Until it makes you bleed.

358
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,416
但是最终 当你向它伸手…
But ultimately, when you reach for it. . .

359
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,656
-它就成了一团泡影 -是的
-It isn't real.  -Yeah.

360
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,916
爱就是一把虚幻的匕首
Love is an imaginary dagger.

361
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,448
没道理吗？
Doesn't make sense, does it?

362
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,115
没有 这比喻太差劲了
No. Terrible metaphor.

363
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,500
该死 我还觉得有点道理呢
-Damn. I thought I had something there.  -

364
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,948
就是他
That's him.

365
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,698
-保持冷静 -没事的
-Stay cool.  -It's gonna be fine.

366
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,500
先生 我能看看你的票吗？
Sir, can I see your tickets?

367
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:29,531
又见面了 你好
You again. Hello.

368
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,833
票 当然 给你
Um, tickets.  Yes, of course. Here they are.

369
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,615
挺可爱的 不是吗？
Oops. Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?

370
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:43,375
有必要这样吗？我可以解释. . .
Look, is this really necessary?  There is a simple explanation. . .

371
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,698
嘿
-Hey.  -GUARD: Huh?

372
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:47,041
你干什么？
What? Hey!

373
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,083
躲开
GUARD: Get out of the way.

374
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,291
扔得太差了
-Awful throw.  -

375
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,750
你能住手吗？
Oh, will you stop it?

376
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,083
再见
Bye.

377
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,000
时间控制器
TemPad.

378
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:02,156
好吧 我可没想这样
Well, that's not ideal.

379
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:06,375
-给我时间控制器 -好的 好的
-Give me the TemPad.  -All right. All right. Okay.

380
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,490
我摔得太狠了
Well, I did take quite the tumble.

381
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,865
你这个混蛋 你害死了我们
You asshole. You killed us.

382
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,708
没准可以修好呢 好吗？
Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um. . .

383
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,990
你不是个正经人
You're not a serious man.

384
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,365
没错 我可是神
You're right. I'm a god.

385
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,323
你是个小丑 你在车上喝醉了
You're a clown.  You got drunk on the train.

386
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,240
-我是享乐主义者 我就这样 -我才是享乐主义者
-I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.  -I'm hedonistic.

387
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,156
我保证比你更享乐 但是不会以牺牲任务为代价
A lot more than you, I assure you.  But never at the expense of the mission.

388
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,115
任务？什么任务？
Oh, the mission? The mission?

389
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:42,375
你那光荣的使命？ 省省吧 你根本打不过他们
What, your glorious purpose?  Give me a break. You can't beat them.

390
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,250
好吧
Okay.

391
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:43,250
叫唤让你舒服点了吗？
Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?

392
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,750
舒服点了
Yes, it did.

393
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,791
你也应该试试
You should try it sometime.

394
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,615
现在怎么办？
What now?

395
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,156
-我不知道 你弄坏了时间控制器 -好吧. . .
-I don't know. You broke the TemPad.  -Well. . .

396
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:06,031
那颗行星要撞到我们了
And that planet is about to crash into us.

397
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,490
-是的 但是. . .  -但是什么？
-Well, yes, but. . .  -Yes, but what?

398
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,948
整颗卫星都被摧毁了 是吗？
Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?

399
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,406
对 所有人都死了
Yeah. And everyone on it is killed.

400
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:16,875
-包括我们 -对 包括我们
-Including us.  -Yes, including us.

401
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,250
方舟号呢？
What about the ark?

402
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:25,791
方舟号没能出发 因为被毁灭了
The ark never leaves because it's destroyed.

403
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:30,000
咱们又没上去
Never had us on it.

404
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:37,791
那又怎么样？咱们劫持了方舟号 然后确保它离开这个卫星？
So what? We hijack the ark and make sure it gets off this moon?

405
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:42,541
我觉得这个想法不错
I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.

406
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,166
好吧
Okay.

407
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,250
真的吗？
Really?

408
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:09,198
我这辈子都没走过这么多路
You know, I don't think I've ever walked this much in my life.

409
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,656
那你这辈子过得不错啊
That's a pretty good life.

410
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,740
好吧 没经历过算你走运
Well, you're lucky you missed it.

411
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,656
我有个想法 你附身了我 是不是就可以帮咱们俩走路了
Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me and you could walk for both of us?

412
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,448
我就在潜意识里歇一会
Or I take a nap in my subconscious,

413
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,031
到了你再把我叫醒 好吗？
and then you could just wake me when we arrive. Yeah?

414
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,031
好吧 附身不是这样的
Yeah, that's not how enchantment works.

415
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,781
好吧 那是什么样的？
All right, how does it work?

416
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,448
这不重要
Doesn't matter.

417
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,573
我觉得我告诉你很多我的事了
You know, I feel like I've told you so much about me.

418
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,656
而我对你一无所知
I really don't know the first thing about you.

419
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,823
多亏了战术优势
Thanks for the tactical advantage.

420
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:39,031
你要用那个战术优势杀了我
LOKI: Ah, so, you want to use that tactical advantage to kill me

421
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,240
在时间变异管理局出现的时候
when the TVA shows up.

422
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,781
你不放心吗？
Worried, are you?

423
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,875
我得知道能不能信任你
I just need to know if I can trust you.

424
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,115
好吧
Okay, fine.

425
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:53,115
你想知道附身是怎么做到的
You want to know how enchantment works.

426
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:58,240
我需要和对方有物理接触 然后抓住他们的心智
I have to make physical contact and then grab hold of their mind.

427
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,365
怎么抓？
How?

428
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,865
取决于什么样的心智
It depends on the mind.

429
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,990
大多数很容易 我立刻就能操控他们
Most are easy and I can overtake them instantly.

430
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,615
另外那些心智强大的 就比较麻烦
Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky.

431
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,573
我操控他们 但是他们自己也在
I'm in control, but they're there, too.

432
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,490
为了保持控制
In order to preserve the connection,

433
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,250
我就需要创造一个他们记忆中的幻想
I have to create a fantasy from their memories.

434
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:20,583
这你还说我是魔法师
And you call me a magician.

435
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,948
那个时间变异管理局的年轻士兵 她的心智很不稳定
That young soldier from the TVA,  her mind was messed up.

436
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,573
一切都被掩盖了
Everything clouded.

437
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,406
我得找到几百年前的记忆
I had to pull a memory from hundreds of years prior,

438
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,615
才能让她努力接受
before she even fought for them.

439
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,823
什么？你说什么？
What? What'd you just say?

440
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,656
在她加入时间变异管理局之前？
Before she joined the TVA?

441
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,698
是啊 她就是个地球上的普通人
