我聽說了一些關於復仇者聯盟離婚的事。

228
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,332
哦嘿。
Oh, hey.

229

這些垃圾是什麼？

不是布達佩斯布達佩斯。

是」布達佩斯」隨便啦。

抱歉讓你費這麼大勁，我會讓你扔掉的。
Sorry you went through the trouble. I would've told you to chuck it.

00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,939
好吧，如果你不想要，就把它扔進垃圾桶。
Well, if you don't want it, throw it in the rubbish.

你不是運動員，邦德先生。

00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,139
因為我發現他喜歡我。

墾月者一號準備發射。

我很確定羅斯在這裏沒有管轄權。
I'm pretty sure Ross has no jurisdiction here.

248
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,048
你應該知道我生氣的時候槍法更準。
And you should know I'm a better shot when I'm pissed off.

249
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,863
你不是來找我的。
You're not here for me.

250
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,306
該死。
Oh, shit.

251
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,489
我知道你在外面。

娜塔莎: 我知道你知道我在這裏。
NATASHA: I know you know I'm out here.

253
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,586
那你為什麼鬼鬼祟祟的，好像這裏是雷區一樣？
YELENA: Then why are you skulking about like it's a minefield?

254
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,713
娜塔莎: 因為我不知道能否信任你。
NATASHA: 'Cause I don't know if I can trust you.

255
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,799
有意思，我也想說同樣的話。
Funny, I was going to say the same thing.

256
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,013
娜塔莎: 那麼，我們要像成年人一樣談話嗎？
NATASHA: So, we gonna talk like grownups?

257
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,725
我們就是這樣嗎？
Is that what we are?

258
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,779
放下槍，否則我要你好看。
Put it down before I make you.

259
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,030
你把槍放下。
You put yours down.

趴下趴下
Stay down.

263
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,187
你非得來布達佩斯不是嗎？
You had to come to Budapest, didn't you?

264
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,482
我來這裏是因為我以為你不會。
I came here because I thought you wouldn't.

265
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:47,361
但既然你在這裏，什麼子彈能做到這一點？
But since you're here, what bullet does that?

266
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,782
不是子彈，是箭。
Not bullets. Arrows.

267
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,033
啊，對。
Ah, right.

268
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,370
如果你認為我不會來這裏，為什麼還寄這個給我？
If you didn't think I'd come here, why'd you send me this?

269
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,413
你把它帶回來了？
You brought it back here?

270
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,460
我不是來和你做朋友的，但你得告訴我那是什麼。
I'm not here trying to be your friend, but you need to tell me what that is.

271
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,045
這是一種合成氣體。
YELENA: It's a synthetic gas.

272
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,589
化學抑制劑化學抑制的中和劑。

00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,010
下次用英語怎麼樣？
Maybe in English next time?

276
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,642
你為什麼不把它帶給你的超級科學家朋友呢？
Why don't you take it to one of your superscientist friends?

277
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,935
他們可以解釋給你聽。
They can explain it to you.

278
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,603
也許是托尼 · 斯塔克？
Tony Stark, maybe?

279
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,273
我們現在不怎麼說話所以..。
Oh, yeah. We're not really talking right now, so...

280
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,400
太好了來得正是時候。
Great. Perfect timing.

281
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,652
當你需要一個復仇者的時候，他在哪裏？
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

282
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,820
我不想待在這裏。
I don't wanna be here.

283
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,239
我在逃命，你差點害死我。
I'm on the run. You could've gotten me killed.

284
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,991
那我該怎麼辦？
Well, what was I supposed to do?

285
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:37,077
你是我認識的唯一一個超級英雄。

286
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,039
這就是我寄給你的全部原因。
That was the whole reason I sent it to you.

287
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,586
我一直在看新聞,

拿下紅房間? 你在說什麼？

293
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,188
我殺了他。
I killed him.

294
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,440
你不會真的相信吧？
You don't actually believe that, do you?

295
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,155
你真的這麼認為。
You really do believe that.

296
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:14,740
德雷科夫死了。

It took almost destroying the entire city just to get to him.

298
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,911
如果你這麼肯定，那就告訴我發生了什麼。
If you're so sure, then tell me what happened.

299
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,704
準確地告訴我。
Tell me exactly.

300
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:22,664
我們安裝了炸彈。
We rigged bombs.

301
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,333
」我們」是誰?克林特 · 巴頓。
Who's "we"? Clint Barton.

302
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,544
殺死德雷科夫是我叛逃到神盾局的最後一步。
Killing Dreykov was the final step in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

303
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,089
就這麼簡單？
Simple as that?

304
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,177
當然」簡單」
Yeah, sure, "simple."

305
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,679
這就是我所說的五層樓的內爆
That's what I'd call imploding a fivestory building

306
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,933
然後和匈牙利特種部隊一起射擊。
and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces.

307
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,144
我們躲了10天才逃出布達佩斯。
Took 10 days in hiding before we could even get out of Budapest.

308
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,896
你檢查了屍體？
And you checked the body?

309
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,648
確認殺人了嗎？
Confirmed the kill?

310
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,986
沒有屍體留下來檢查。
There was no body left to check.

311
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,782
你忘了德雷科夫的女兒。
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

312
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,718
娜塔莎: 我們要去哪裏？
NATASHA: Where are we trying to get?

313
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,887
葉連娜: 摩托車! 大樓東側。
YELENA: Motorbike! East side of the building.

314
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,294
我抓住你了！
I got you!

315
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,007
不!
No!

316
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,777
嘿。
Hey.

317
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,987
別動，你受傷了。
Don't move. You're hurt.

318
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,364
我來幫你。
Let me help you.

319
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,451


320
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,760
你在幹什麼?他逼我的。
What are you doing? He's making me.

321
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,625
你現在相信我了嗎？
Do you believe me now?

322
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,545
還有多少人？
How many others?

323
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,088
夠了。
Enough.

324
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,894
娜塔莎: 哪一個是你的？
NATASHA: Which one's yours?

325
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,478
黑色，棕色的座位。
Black. Brown seat.

326
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,522
我的鑰匙呢？
Where are my keys?

327
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:20,986
隨時都有可能。
Any day now.

328
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,737
你不能偷別人的車。
You can't just steal a guy's car.

329
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,739
所以你想讓我追蹤他然後取消偷竊？
So you want me to chase him down and unsteal it?

330
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,870
好的，請隨時開始閉嘴。
Okay. Any time now, please. Shut up.

331
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,373


332
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,573
好吧你有個計劃,
Okay, you got a plan,

333
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,199
還是繼續躲躲藏藏？
or shall I just stay duckandcover?

334
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,659
是的，我的計劃是把我們趕走。
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

335
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,202
這計劃爛透了。
That's a shit plan.

336
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,091
舉手之勞，何足掛齒。
You're welcome.

337
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,647
該死，他回來了。
Oh, shit. He's back.

338
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,286
繫上安全帶。
Put your seat belt on.

339
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:35,662
你真是個好媽媽。
You're such a mom.

340
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,112
娜塔莎，不。
YELENA: Natasha, no.

341
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,323
我想我在流血，我..。
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

342
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,285
不現在不行相信我。
No. Not now, trust me.

343
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,839
你還好嗎？
You okay?

344
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,717
好主意。
Yeah. Great plan.

345
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,470
我喜歡我差點流血而死的那部分。
I love the part where I almost bled to death.

346
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,432
這裏很舒適。
This is cozy.

347
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,185
巴頓和我在這裏躲了兩天。
Barton and I spent two days hiding out up here.

348
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,936
那一定很有趣。
That must have been fun.

349
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,064
那傢伙到底是誰？
Who the hell is that guy?

350
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,608
德雷科夫的特別項目。
Dreykov's special project.

351
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,152
他可以模仿任何他見過的人。
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

352
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,445
這就像和鏡子搏鬥一樣。
It's like fighting a mirror.

353
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,281
德雷科夫只有在最重要的任務時才會派遣他。
Dreykov only deploys him for toppriority missions.

354
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,116
這沒有任何意義。
This doesn't make any sense.

355
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,745
當你忽略關鍵細節的時候，事實很難說得通。
Well, the truth rarely makes sense when you omit key details.

356
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,873
這是什麼意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

357
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,000
你一個字都沒提過德雷科夫的女兒。
You didn't say one word about Dreykov's daughter.

358
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,711
你殺了她。
You killed her.

359
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,755
我必須這麼做。
I had to.

360
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,716
我需要她帶我找到德雷科夫。
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

361
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,553
我們需要確認德雷科夫在大樓裏。
We need confirmation Dreykov's in the building.

362
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,598
娜塔莎: 他的車現在停下來了。
NATASHA: His car is pulling up now.

363
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,576
德雷科夫的女兒是附帶傷害。
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

364
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,413
我需要她的確認。
I needed her to be sure.

365
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,123
娜塔莎，明白了嗎？
Natasha, we clear?

366
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,418
一切正常。
All clear.

367
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,050
而你在這裏，卻不那麼確定。
And here you are, not so sure.

368
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,719
我需要出去走走。
I needed out.

369
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,028
紅房間還在運行，它在哪裏？
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

370
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,196
我不知道。
I have no idea.

371
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,116
他經常搬家。
He moves location constantly.

372
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:03,745
每個寡婦在出入境時都要服用鎮靜劑，以獲得最高安全級別。
And every widow is sedated on entry and exit for maximum security.

373
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,458
我只是覺得很難相信他能躲開我的視線。
I'm just finding it hard to believe that he could stay off my radar.

374
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,171
如果你想躲起來就攻擊復仇者是不明智的。
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger if you want to stay hidden.

375
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,506
線索就在名字裏。
I mean, the clue is in the name.

376
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,966
德雷科夫殺了你,
Dreykov kills you,

377
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,886
其中一個大人物會來為你報仇。
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

378
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,387
等等，大的是什麼？
Wait, what are the big ones?

379
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:24,933
好吧，我懷疑來自太空的上帝在戰鬥後一定要服用布洛芬。
Well, I doubt the god from space has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

380
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,605
你以為我這段時間在哪兒？
Where did you think I was all this time?

381
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:36,695
我以為你出獄了，過著正常的生活。
I thought that you got out and were living a normal life.

382
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,115
然後你就再也沒聯繫過她？
And you just never made contact again?

383
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,159
說實話我以為你不想見我。
Honestly, I thought you didn't wanna see me.

384
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,870
胡說八道。
Bullshit.

385
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,706
你只是不想你的小妹妹跟著你,
You just didn't want your baby sister to tag along,

386
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,583
同時你和酷小孩拯救了世界。
whilst you saved the world with the cool kids.

387
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,710
你不是我真正的妹妹。
You weren't really my sister.

388
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,591
復仇者並不是你真正的家人。
And the Avengers aren't really your family.

389
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,135
你為什麼總是這樣做?做什麼？
Why do you always do that thing? NATASHA: Do what?

390
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,763
你們吵架的時候要做的事。
The thing you do when you're fighting.

391
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,265
那個... 那個..。
The... Like, the...

392
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,185
你做的這件事
This thing that you do

393
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,395
當你在打架的時候甩動你的頭髮
when you whip your hair when you're fighting

394
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,022
手臂和頭髮。
with the arm and the hair.

395
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,525
然後你擺出一個打鬥的姿勢。
And you do, like, a fighting pose.

396
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:18,028
這是個打架的姿勢，你完全是個裝腔作勢的人。
It's a fighting pose. You're a total poser.

397
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,113
我不是裝腔作勢的人
I'm not a poser.

398
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,115
拜託這些姿勢都很棒,
Oh, come on. I mean, they're great poses,

399
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,952
但你覺得大家都在看著你,
but it does look like you think everyone's looking at you, like,

400
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,119
一直。
all the time.

401
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,623
我花了那麼多時間擺造型，其實是想做點好事
All that time that I spent posing, I was trying to actually do something good

402
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,210
來彌補我們帶來的痛苦。
to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused.

403
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,754
試著不僅僅是一個訓練有素的殺手。
Trying to be more than just a trained killer.

404
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,051
那你是在自欺欺人
Well, then you were fooling yourself

405
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,556
因為痛苦和折磨每天都在發生，而我們都是訓練有素的殺手。
because pain and suffering is every day and we are both still a trained killer.

406
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,934
只是我不是雜誌封面上的那個人。
Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine.

407
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,311
我不是那種被小女孩們稱為英雄的殺手。
I'm not the killer that little girls call their hero.

408
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,831
那種氣體,
That gas,

409
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,250
反作用劑,
the counteragent,

410
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,169
它是秘密合成的
it was synthesized in secret

411
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,005
梅麗娜那一代的一個老寡婦。
by an older widow from Melina's generation.

412
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,550
我在執行取回它的任務，而她暴露了我
I was on the mission to retrieve it, and she exposed me

413
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:25,554
我殺了釋放我的寡婦。
and I killed the widow that freed me.

414
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,306
你有選擇嗎？
Did you have a choice?

415
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,267
你所經歷的是心理調節。
What you experienced was psychological conditioning.

416
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,813
我說的是化學改變大腦功能。
I'm talking about chemically altering brain functions.

417
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,191
它們完全是兩碼事。
They're two completely different things.

418
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,612
你完全有意識，但是你不知道哪一部分是你自己。
You're fully conscious, but you don't know which part is you.

419
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,405
我還是不確定。
I'm still not sure.

420
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,875
就剩這些了?嗯哼。
Is that all there is left? Mmmhmm.

421
00:47:55,834 --> 00:48:00,047
只有這樣才能阻止德雷科夫和他的寡婦網絡。
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov and his network of widows.

422
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,134
他每天都吃得更多。
He takes more every day.

423
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,095
沒有人保護他們的孩子。
Children who don't have anyone to protect them.

424
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:08,514
就像我們小時候一樣。
Just like us when we were small.

425
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,642
也許20個人中就有一個能在訓練中存活下來，成為寡婦。
Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow.

426
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,185
剩下的，他殺人。
The rest, he kills.

427
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,146
對他來說，我們只是東西。
To him, we are just things.

428
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,567
沒有臉的武器，他可以隨便扔掉。
Weapons with no face that he can just throw away.

429
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,488
因為總會有更多。
Because there is always more.

430
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,325
沒人在找他多虧了你和阿列克謝。
And no one's even looking for him, thanks to you and Alexei.

431
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,118
娜塔莎: 阿列克謝?
NATASHA: Alexei?

432
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,330
YELENA: 「爸爸。」
YELENA: "Dad."

433
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,927
你有沒有找過你的父母? 你真正的父母？
YELENA: Did you ever look for your parents? Your real ones?

434
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:52,766
我媽把我像垃圾一樣丟在街上。
Well, my mom abandoned me in the street like garbage.

435
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,271
你呢？
What about you?

436
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,942
他們毀了我的出生證明，所以我重新發明了它。
They destroyed my birth certificate, so I reinvented it.

437
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,070
我父母還住在俄亥俄州。
My parents still live in Ohio.

438
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,073
我妹妹搬到西部去了。
My sister moved out west.

439
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,157
是這樣嗎？
Is that right?

440
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,868
你是個科學老師。
You're a science teacher.

441
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,873
不過你現在是兼職工作，尤其是在你有了兒子之後。
You're working parttime, though, especially after you had your son.

442
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,709
你丈夫，他負責裝修房子。
Your husband, he renovates houses.

443
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,170
這不是我的故事
That is not my story.

444
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,046
你的故事是什麼？
What is your story?

445
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:30,012
我從來沒有讓自己獨處足夠長的時間去思考它。
I never let myself be alone long enough to think about it.

446
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,935
你有沒有想過要孩子？
Did you ever wish for kids?

447
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,274
我想要一隻狗。
I want a dog.

448
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:49,948
你要去哪裏？
Where you gonna go?

449
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,700
我不知道。
I don't know.

450
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:56,455
我真的沒有地方可以回去了,
I don't really have anywhere to go back to,

451
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,123
所以我猜隨便哪裏都行。
so I guess anywhere.

452
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,465
不要不要什麼？
Don't. Don't what?

453
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,092
你要給我一些大英雄的演講,
You're going to give me some big hero speech,

454
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,177
我能感覺到。
I can feel it.

455
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,096
我不擅長演講。
Speeches aren't really my thing.

456
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,181
哈。
Huh.

457
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,558
這更像是一種邀請。
It was more like an invitation.

458
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,187
去紅房間殺掉德雷科夫？
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

459
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:21,813
是的。
Yeah.

460
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,233
儘管紅房間很難找到
Even though the Red Room is impossible to find

461
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:26,360
德雷科夫太狡猾殺不了人嗎？
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

462
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,569
是的。
Yeah.

463
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,572
聽起來工作量很大。
That sounds like a shitload of work.

464
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,954
不過應該會很有趣。
Could be fun, though.

465
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,373
是的。
Yup.

466
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,422
我看到他把鑰匙放哪兒了。
I saw where he put the keys.

467
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,009
最上面的抽屜，綠色的櫃子。
Top drawer, green cabinet.

468
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:03,021
你知道嗎，這是第一件
You know, this is the first piece of clothing

469
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,606
買給自己的最好的禮物。
I've ever bought for myself.

470
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:07,985
那個？
That?

471
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,570
是啊，你不喜歡？
Yeah. You don't like it?

472
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,280
那是不是像..。
Is that like a...

473
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,365
是軍隊剩餘還是..。
Is it army surplus, or...

474
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,992
好吧，它有很多口袋。
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

475
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,703
但我一直在用,
But I use them all the time,

476
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:20,080
我自己做了一些修改。
and I made some of my own modifications.

477
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,874
隨便啦。
Whatever.

478
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,251
閉嘴重點是我從沒..。
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

479
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,713
我以前從來沒有控制過自己的生活，現在我做到了。
I've never had control over my own life before, and now I do.

480
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,548
我想做一些事情。
I want to do things.

481
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,508
娜塔莎: 嗯... ..。
NATASHA: Hmm...

482
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:32,968
我喜歡你的背心。
I like your vest.

483
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,846
我就知道，我就知道，很酷吧？
I knew it. I knew you did. It's so cool, right?

484
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,139
很好，是的，我喜歡。
It's good. Yes. I like it.

485
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,684
你可以在裏面放很多東西，你甚至不會知道。
And you can put so much stuff in there. You wouldn't even know.

486
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,815
不過我真的不知道紅房間在哪裏。
I really don't know where the Red Room is, though.

487
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,984
對不起我知道。
I'm sorry. I know.

488
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,987
但我想我知道有人知道。
But I think I know somebody who does.

489
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,155
是嗎? 誰？
Oh, yeah? Who?

490
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,490
我們需要一架飛機。
We're gonna need a jet.

491
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,619
我說我們需要一架飛機。
I said we needed a jet.

492
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,538
你知道你沒給我什麼嗎? 時間。
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me? Time.

493
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,290
或者錢，我不是飛機做的。
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

494
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,958
我以為你是最棒的。
YELENA: I thought you were supposed to be the best.

495
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,043
像個真正的專業人士。
Like a real pro.

496
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,419
哦，對不起，皇后。
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

497
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,379
是免費的公寓和終身供應的基塞爾
Was the free flat and lifetime supply of kissel

498
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,131
你不喜歡?哈！
not to your liking? Ha!

499
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,883
娜塔莎: 別讓她把你惹毛了。
NATASHA: Don't let her wind you up.

500
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,469
不，我反對質疑我的專業性。
No, I take exception to impugning my professionalism.

501
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:19,473
你確實給我安排了一個六小時後就壞掉的發電機。
Well, you did set me up with a generator that crapped out after six hours.

502
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,892
你也是哈?雙人搭檔。
You, too, huh? Tag team.

503
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:25,145
哦，他很敏感，看看你為什麼把他留在身邊。
Aw, he's sensitive. See why you keep him around.

504
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,772
娜塔莎: 其他的呢？
NATASHA: Where's the rest?

505
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,613
就是這樣。
Voila.

506
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,448
耶倫娜: 哦。
YELENA: Ooh.

507
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,159
我大概五年前藏起來的。
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

508
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,496
怎麼樣？
How is it?

509
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,874
很乾，真的很乾。
It's dry. It's really dry.

510
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,006
你知道，你有一個危險接近的時間來結清你的賬單。
You know, you're getting dangerously close to running out your tab.

511
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,135
物資我可以統計但你得引起當局的注意,
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me attention from the authorities,

512
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,846
我的價格都上漲了。
all my prices go up.

513
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:01,974
那是什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

514
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,185
你的朋友，羅斯部長，一直在打聽我的事
Your mate, Secretary Ross, has been sniffing around my affairs

515
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,313
直到我的聯繫人拒絕我的電話。
to the point at which I've got contacts declining my calls.

516
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,399
我是個私人承包商。
I'm a private contractor.

517
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,402
你很敏感。
You are sensitive.

518
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,112
你真是個討厭的傢伙。
You're a very annoying individual.

519
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,241
我會補償你的嗯。
I'll make it up to you. Mmmhmm.

520
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,160
你每次都這麼說。
That's what you say every time.

521
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,627
所以，我有核密碼。
So, I have the nuclear code.

522
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:34,256
但他就在那兒。
But there he is.

523
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,969
美國隊長!美國。
Captain America! INMATES: America.

524
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,267
紅色衛士的時代終於來臨了！
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

525
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,645
我抓住他的盾牌
I grab hold of his shield

526
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:54,526
面對面，這是對力量的考驗。
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

527
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,825
哦... 哦，不。
Oh... Oh, no.

528
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,703
哦..。
Oh...

529
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,207
那傢伙以為他能打敗我。
That guy think he going to beat me.

530
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,876
不管怎樣，這個盾牌，你知道，他隨身帶著
Anyway, this shield, you know, that he carries with him

531
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:13,837
就像寶寶的毯子，你知道嗎？
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

532
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,173
我利用這一點，我利用這一點
I use it to my advantage. I take it

533
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,424
我把他推出窗外。
and I push him out the window.

534
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,052
然後我就逃走了？
And I make my escape. Huh?

535
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,262
今年是哪一年？
What year was this?

536
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,891
我不知道，大概83,84年吧。
I don't know. Like, '83, '84.

537
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:27,059
我知道。
I know.

538
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:30,437
那時的美國隊長還被冰凍著。
Captain America was still frozen in ice then.

539
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,777
你是在說我是個騙子嗎，爾薩？
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

540
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,241


541
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,792
哦，不。
Oh, no.

542
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,961
啊哦。
Uhoh.

543
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,464
看那隻大熊。
Aw, look at the big bear.

544
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,299
要哭了嗎，小姑娘？
Gonna cry, little girl?

545
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:14,166
今天是你的幸運日，阿列克謝。
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

546
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,253
到南邊牆上的門那裏去。
Move to the door on the south wall.

547
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,318
左轉。
Go left.

548
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:43,820
只是別大吵大鬧。
Just don't make a scene.

549
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,663


550
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,255
你把事情鬧大了，是不是？
You made a scene, didn't you?

551
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,893
現在怎麼辦？
What now?

552
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,895
我們要帶你離開這裏。
We're gettin' you outta here.

553
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,126
到上面一層去。
Go to the upper level.

554
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,131
快點，超級戰士。
Move your ass, super soldier.

555
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:57,686
他不可能成功的。
He's never going to make it.

556
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,271
靠近點。
Get me closer.

557
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:01,815
你有更好的主意嗎？
You got a better idea?

558
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,029
娜塔莎。
ALEXEI: Natasha.

559
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,209
裝腔作勢的傢伙。
Such a poser.

560
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:43,482


561
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,276
真的嗎？
Seriously?

562
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:48,862
喔！
Whoo!

563
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,739
對不起！
Sorry!

564
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,118
你在幹什麼? 開什麼玩笑？
What are you doing? Are you kidding me?

565
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,954
退後！
Back up!

566
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,790
我們都做得很好。
YELENA: We're both doing a really good job.

567
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,926
沒有。
No.

568
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,721
好了夠了。
Okay. Enough of this.

569
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,364
哈！
Ha!

570
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,249
哇..。
Whoa...

571
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,423
這將是一個很酷的死法。
This would be a cool way to die.

572
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,470
告訴我這對我們來說是個好兆頭！
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

573
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:56,763
快點！
Move your ass!

574
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,831
快救我們出去！
Get us outta here!

575
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,625
哈。
Huh.

576
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,420
等等！
Wait!

577
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,115
太好了！
Yes!

578
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:40,117


579
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,452
我這裏需要幫助！
I need some help up here!

580
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,342
哦，真令人興奮。
Oh, that was exciting.

581
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:02,556
我真為你們感到驕傲。
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

582
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,143
你聽不見我說話？
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

583
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,312
好吧。
Okay.

584
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,150
哇。
Wow.

585
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,197
好吧。
Okay.

586
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,283
為什麼這麼咄咄逼人？
Why the aggression, huh?

587
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,535
這是你每月的大姨媽嗎？
Is it your time of the month?

588
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:27,122
我沒來例假，笨蛋，我沒有子宮。
I don't get my period, dipshit. I don't have a uterus.

589
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,498
或者卵巢。
Or ovaries.

590
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:30,959
是啊，這就是紅房間
Yeah. That's what happens when the Red Room

591
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,461
讓你做非自願子宮切除術。
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

592
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:37,174
它們就這麼進去，然後把你所有的生殖器官都扯出來。
They kind of just go in and they rip out all of your reproductive organs.

593
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:40,802
他們就這麼衝進去，把他們都剁了。
They just get right in there and they chop them all away.

594
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,805
所有東西都拿出來了所以你不能生孩子好了好了好了好了！
Everything out, so you can't have babies. ALEXEI: Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

595
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:46,475
你沒必要這麼客觀和下流。
You don't have to get so clinical and nasty.

596
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,143
我正要說到
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

597
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,479
輸卵管不過沒關係沒有。
fallopian tubes, but okay. ALEXEI: No.

598
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:56,860
你回來救我對我來說意義重大。
It means so much to me that you came back for me.

599
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,614
不，不，你得告訴我們怎麼去紅房間。
No. No. You're gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room.

600
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:02,282
哈。
Huh.

601
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,159
哇，看看你，哈? ，都是生意。
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

602
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:05,744
相信我，這不是快樂。
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

603
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,957
小娜塔莎，全都被灌輸進了西方的議事日程。
Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

604
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:13,252
我選擇去西部成為一名復仇者。
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

605
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,379
因為他們視我如家人。
'Cause they treated me like family.

606
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,381
真的嗎? 家人？
ALEXEI: Really? Family?

607
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,842
他們現在在哪兒？
Well, where are they now?

608
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,678
那家人現在在哪兒？
Where is that family now?

609
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,847
告訴我紅房間在哪裏。
Tell me where the Red Room is.

610
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,977
我不知道
I have no idea.

611
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,228
好嗎？
ALEXEI: Okay?

612
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,860
拜託你和德雷科夫就像..。
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

613
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:39,027
德雷科夫?是的。
Dreykov? Yeah.

614
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,530
德雷科夫將軍，我的朋友？
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

615
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,032
給我榮耀..。
Gives me glory...

616
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,202
蘇聯第一個也是唯一一個超級士兵。
Soviet Union's first and only super soldier.

617
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:50,539
我本可以比美國隊長更出名。
I could have been more famous than Captain America.

618
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:54,126
然後他把我埋在俄亥俄去執行那個愚蠢的任務。
Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission.

619
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,711
三年！
Three years!

620
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,839
太無聊了，讓我無聊到流淚。
So tedious, boring me to tears.

621
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,260
無意冒犯？
No offense, huh?

622
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,763
然後讓我在監獄裏度過餘生，為什麼？
Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

623
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,307
為什麼? 為什麼他要把我放進... 你知道為什麼嗎？
Why? Why would he put me in... You know why?

624
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,143
因為也許我想談談國家的衰落。
'Cause maybe I want to talk about the withering of the state.

625
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,895
或者也許我不喜歡他的頭髮什麼的
Or maybe I don't like his hair or something

626
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:14,229
我隨口說了幾句。
and I say something casually about that.

627
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,397
也許，你知道,
Maybe, you know,

628
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,524
我想讓這個派對感覺像個真正的派對
I want the Party to feel actually like a party

629
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,068
而不是這個討厭的組織。
instead of this sourpuss organization.

630
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,404
但事實並非如此。
But instead, no.

631
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,574
他讓我在監獄裏度過餘生。
He puts me in prison for the rest of my life.

632
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,868
他就這麼跑掉躲起來了？
He just runs off and hides, huh?

633
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,788
我甚至不是那個..。
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

634
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,792
又不是我殺了他女兒。
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

635
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,921
我們現在能把他扔出窗外嗎？
Can we throw him out the window now?

636
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,006
我認為我們應該等到更高的海拔再行動。
I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude.

637
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,090
好吧。
All right.

638
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:45,969
等等，梅琳娜媽媽？
Wait, Mom Melina?

639
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,138
我們以為她死了
We thought she was dead.

640
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:51,016
那麼快的狐貍是殺不死的。
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

641
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,351
噁心什麼？
Ew. ALEXEI: What?

642
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:57,105
她是科學家，戰略家，我是打手。
She was the scientist, the strategist. I was the muscle.

643
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,775
她直接為德雷科夫工作的次數比我多得多。
She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did.

644
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:03,403
等等，你是說梅麗娜現在在紅房間工作？
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is working for the Red Room present day?

645
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,822
她在聖彼得堡城外遠程工作。
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

646
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:07,741
呃..。
Uh...

647
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:10,661
我想我們沒有足夠的燃料去聖彼得堡。
I don't think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg.

648
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:12,412
不用了，我們可以的。
No, we're good. We'll make it.

649
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,039
好吧。
Okay.

650
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,603
你應該帶上復仇者的超級噴氣機。
You should've brought the Avengers' superjet.

651
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,734
我發誓如果我再聽到他說一個字,
I swear, if I hear one more word from him,

652
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:44,736
我會踢他的臉他是最壞的。
I will kick him in the face.  He's the worst.

653
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,822
娜塔莎。
ALEXEI: Natasha.

654
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,365
娜塔莎娜塔莎。
Natasha. Natasha.

655
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,451
過來，我想問你點事。
Come here, I want to ask you something.

656
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,537
來吧，這很重要什麼？
Come, it's important. What?

657
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,626
他跟你提起過我嗎？
Did he talk to you about me?

658
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,004
什麼？
What?

659
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,175
他跟你提起過我嗎? 你知道，交換戰爭故事？
Did he talk to you about me? You know, trading war stories?

660
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,342
誰? 你在說什麼？
Who? What are you talking about?

661
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,761
美國隊長。
Captain America.

662
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,892
在這個地緣政治衝突的舞台上，我最大的對手。
My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

663
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,894
與其說是復仇女神。
Not so much a nemesis.

664
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,979
更像一個現代人，你知道嗎? Coequal。
More like a contemporary, you know? Coequal.

665
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:21,356
我一直認為我們之間有很多相互尊重。
I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect...

666
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,567
等等你都20年沒見過我們了
Wait. You haven't seen either one of us in 20 years

667
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,277
你要問我關於你的事嗎？
and you're gonna ask me about you?

668
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,572
這種緊張關係是怎麼回事？
What is with this tension?

669
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,825
我做錯什麼了嗎？
Did I do something wrong?

670
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,995
這是個嚴肅的問題嗎？
Is that a serious question?

671
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,248
我只愛過你們，姑娘們。
I only ever loved you girls.

672
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:40,918
我盡最大努力確保你會成功
I did my best to make sure you would succeed

673
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,920
充分發揮你的潛能,
to achieve your fullest potential,

674
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,755
一切都解決了一切都解決了？
and everything worked out. Everything worked out?

675
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,299
是的對你來說是的。
Yes. For you, yes.

676
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:51,428
我們在俄亥俄州完成了任務。
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

677
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,973
葉蓮娜，你繼續成為最偉大的兒童殺手
Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin

678
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,350
世界上最偉大的人。
the world has ever known.

679
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:00,479
沒有人能比得上你的效率，你的冷酷無情。
No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness.

680
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,606
還有娜塔莎,
And Natasha,

681
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,653
不僅僅是間諜不僅僅是推翻政權,
not just a spy, not just toppling regimes,

682
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,947
從內部摧毀帝國,
destroying empires from within,

683
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,282
而是復仇者。
but an Avenger.

684
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,161
你們兩個都殺了
You both have killed

685
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,705
這麼多人。
so many people.

686
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,960
你的賬本一定在滴水，血流成河。
Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red.

687
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,712
我真為你感到驕傲。
I couldn't be more proud of you.

688
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,468
好吧你可以... 不。
Okay. You can... No.

689
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,387
放開我。
Let go of me now.

690
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,347
你聞起來真臭。
You smell really bad.

691
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,229
那麼，我們到了嗎？
So, are we there yet?

692
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,439
我們到了你就知道了。
You'll know when we're there.

693
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,151
輕微右轉。
MELINA: Slight right.

694
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:50,696
直走。
Straight on.

695
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,531
對。
Right.

696
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:56,159
輕微右轉。
Slight right.

697
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,496
非常好，親愛的。
Oh, very good, my darling.

698
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:02,833
是的，非常好。
Yes, very good.

699
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,086
是的，非常好，親愛的
Yes, very good, my darling.

700
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:21,727
回到安全的地方，快點，快走。
Back home where it's safe. Come on. Go on.

701
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,570
親愛的我們回來了。
Honey, we're home.

702
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,500
來吧姑娘們。
Come on, girls.

703
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,304
歡迎光臨寒舍。
Welcome to my humble abode.

704
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,723
不要拘束。
Make yourself at home.

705
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,452
娜塔莎: 嘿，別耍花招。
NATASHA: Hey, no funny business.

706
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,873
我要放下武器。
I am putting away my weapon.

707
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:30,939
娜塔莎: 這附近有陷阱嗎？
NATASHA: Are there any booby traps around here?

708
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,107
有什麼我們需要知道的嗎？
Anything we need to know about?

709
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,901
我養育我的女兒們不是為了讓她們落入陷阱。
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

710
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,819
你根本沒有撫養我們長大。
You didn't raise us at all.

711
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,448
也許吧。
Oh, maybe so.

712
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:43,118
但是如果你變軟弱了，那就不是在我的監視下。
But if you got soft, it wasn't on my watch.

713
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,351
我們喝酒吧。
Let's drink.

714
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,437
好的。
ALEXEI: Okay.

715
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:22,991
還是很合適。
Still fits.

716
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,203
天啊。
Oh, my God.

717
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:30,624
梅麗娜: 我一次也沒洗過。
MELINA: I never washed it once.

718
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,376
過來喝一杯。
Come and drink.

719
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:38,340
起來吧，你們這些拯救者
Rise, you workers of salvation

720
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,220
家庭
Family

721
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,848
重新聚在一起。
back together again.

722
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,642
嗯鑒於我們
Mmm. Seeing as our

723
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:49,893
家庭結構
family construct

724
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,855
只是一個計劃好的詭計只持續了三年,
was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years,

725
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:57,359
我想我們不能再用這個詞了，對吧？
I don't think that we can use this term anymore, can we?

726
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,987
同意接下來這麼辦。
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

727
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:03,282
好吧，那就再聚一次，嗯？
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

728
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:04,533
還有..。
And, uh...

729
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,119
我想馬上說點什麼。
I want to say something right off the bat.

730
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,413
你一點都沒變老，是吧？
You haven't aged a day, huh?

731
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,710
你就像他們安排我們結婚那天一樣美麗溫柔。
You're just as beautiful and as supple as the day they staged our marriage.

732
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,671
梅麗娜: 你變胖了。
MELINA: You got fat.

733
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,966
但還是不錯的
But still good.

734
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,886
我剛從監獄出來。
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

735
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,347
我精力充沛哦！
I have a lot of energy. MELINA: Oh!

736
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,349
請不要這樣做。
Please don't do that.

737
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,437
接下來是這樣的。
So, here's what's gonna happen.

738
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,022
娜塔莎，別垂頭喪氣的。
Natasha, don't slouch.

739
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,900
我沒有無精打采不，你有。
I'm not slouching. MELINA: Yes, yes, you are.

740
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,984
我並不懶散。
I don't slouch.

741
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:40,194
你會得到一個背部隆起。
You're going to get a back hunch.

742
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,612
聽你媽媽的話娜塔莎: 哦，天哪，這..。
Listen to your mother. NATASHA: Oh, my God, this...

743
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:42,696
起來，起來。
Up, up.

744
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,198
好了，夠了，你們所有人。
All right, enough. All of you.

745
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,116
我什麼都沒說，這不公平。
I didn't say anything. That's not fair.

746
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:47,784
事情是這樣的...我不想吃東西。
Here's what's gonna happen... I don't want any food.

747
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,953
梅麗娜: 吃點東西吧，葉連娜，看在上帝的份上。
MELINA: Eat a little something, Yelena, for God's sake.

748
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,788
你得告訴我們紅房間的位置。
You're gonna tell us the location of the Red Room.

749
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,504
就像你告訴他們
You know, it's like when you told them

750
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,714
他們可以熬夜抓聖誕老人。
that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus.

751
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:02,966
什麼? 那很有趣，你知道，「他從煙囪下來，姑娘們。
What? That was fun. You know, "He come down the chimney, girls.

752
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,384
「小心，他在哪兒?」
"Look out. Where is he?"

753
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:07,346
你等著他等餅乾吃完,
You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone,

754
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:09,389
然後你看到他在那裏。
then you see he's there.

755
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,433
不不什麼我想要
No, no. What? I want them

756
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,143
去追尋他們的夢想不好。
to follow their dreams. MELINA: No good.

757
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,354
追求明星吧，姑娘們。
ALEXEI: Reach for the stars, girls.

758
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,023
找到德雷科夫不是幻想，而是未竟的事業。
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy. It's unfinished business.

759
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:22,069
你無法打敗一個支配他人意志的人。
You can't defeat a man who commands the very will of others.

760
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:26,114
你永遠看不到我們在美國開始的事業的頂峰。
You never saw the culmination of what we started in America.

761
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,616
你也沒有。
Nor did you.

762
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:34,498
娜塔莎，集中注意力，集中注意力，得到你想要的。
Natasha, always focus, focus. Get what you want.

763
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,631
進來吧。
Come in.

764
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,515
那頭豬剛才開門了嗎？
Did that pig just open the door?

765
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,767
是的。
Yes. It did.

766
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,687
好孩子，阿列克謝，好孩子。
Good boy, Alexei. Good boy.

767
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:59,481
你用我的名字給一頭豬命名？
You named a pig after me?

768
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,859
你不覺得這很像嗎？
You don't see the resemblance?

769
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,281
看，他像狗一樣坐著。
See, he sits just like dog.

770
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:09,700
太棒了，現在，看著。
Amazing. Now, watch.

771
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,159
對我來說有點奇怪。
ALEXEI: It's a little weird, to me.

772
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,828
停止呼吸。
Stop breathing.

773
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:21,545
我們滲透進了俄亥俄州的北方研究所。
We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio.

774
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,255
那是神盾局科學家的掩護。
It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

775
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,592
事實上，當時的科學家是九頭蛇。
Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time.

776
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,302
結合冬兵計劃,
In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project,

777
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,346
他們解剖並解構了人類的大腦
they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain

778
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:36,185
創造了第一個也是唯一一個基底神經節的細胞藍圖。
to create the first and only cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

779
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,769
是認知的樞紐。
Was the hub for cognition.

780
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:41,231
自主運動，程序性學習。
Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning.

781
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,528
我們沒有竊取武器或技術。
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

782
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,531
我們偷走了釋放自由意志的鑰匙。
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

783
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,371
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

784
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:00,167
我在解釋現在的科學是如此精確,
Oh, I am explaining that the science is now so exact,

785
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,544
可以指示實驗對像停止呼吸
the subject can be instructed to stop breathing

786
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,588
除了服從別無選擇。
and has no choice but to obey.

787
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:06,256
好了，你說得夠清楚了，夠了。
Okay, you made your point. That's enough.

788
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:09,301
是的，好吧，別擔心，阿列克謝本來可以活下來的
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry, Alexei could've survived

789
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:12,054
還有11秒沒有氧氣。
11 more seconds without oxygen.

790
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,015
好孩子，現在你回家去，回到安全的地方。
Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it's safe.

791
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:18,644
你回去，回家，回到安全的地方。
You go. You go back home, back home where it's safe.

792
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,063
好孩子，阿列克謝。
Good boy, Alexei.

793
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,858
當世界被控制的時候，它就在一個更高的層次上運作。
The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled.

794
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:29,404
德雷科夫用化學方法征服了遍佈全球的間諜。
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents planted around the globe.

795
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,698
你知道他們在誰身上測試嗎？
And do you know who they test it on?

796
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,116
梅麗娜: 嗯..。
MELINA: Hmm...

797
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,952
不，那不是我的部門。
No. That's not my department.

798
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,912
啊，快點，快點。
ALEXEI: Ah, come on, come on.

799
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,956
別對他們撒謊我沒撒謊。
Don't lie to them. Hmm? I'm not lying.

800
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:40,582
你是德雷科夫的建築師？
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

801
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:41,750
梅麗娜: 你是什麼？
MELINA: What were you?

802
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,502
如果我是他的建築師，你就是他的搭檔。
If I was his architect, you were his partner.

803
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:44,628
你是他的生意夥伴。
You were his business partner.

804
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:46,004
不，不，不，我是替罪羊！
No, no, no. I was patsy!

805
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,382
別跟我說...他向我兜售意識形態。
Don't give me that... He sell me ideology.

806
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,716
別再談政治了一直以來更大的..。
Stop with the politics. All the while, bigger...

807
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,678
閉嘴! 你是個白癡。
Shut up! You are an idiot.

808
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:58,767
你是個懦夫。
And you're a coward.

809
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:02,729
你是個懦夫。
You're a coward.

810
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:07,025
我們的家庭從來都不是真實的，所以沒有什麼可以堅持的。
And our family was never real, so there's nothing to hold on to.

811
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:09,820
我們繼續前進。
We're moving on.

812
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:12,322
從來沒有家人，是吧？
ALEXEI: Never family, huh?

813
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,158
在我心裏，我是個單純的人。
In my heart, I am simple man.

814
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:19,329
我覺得對於一對深入臥底的俄羅斯特工來說
And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents

815
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,540
我覺得我們做父母做得很好，是吧？
I think we did pretty great as parents, huh?

816
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:25,169
是的，我們有我們的命令，我們完美地扮演了我們的角色。
Yes, we had our orders, and we played our roles to perfection.

817
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,005
誰在乎? 那不是真的。
Who cares? That wasn't real.

818
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,716
什麼?那不是真的，誰在乎？
What? That wasn't real. Who cares?

819
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,634
別這麼說。
Don't say that.

820
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,721
別這麼說，那是真的。
Please don't say that. It was real.

821
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,433
這對我來說是真實的，你是我的母親。
It was real to me. You are my mother.

822
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,352
你是我的親生母親。
You were my real mother.

823
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:45,147
我曾經擁有的最接近的東西。
The closest thing I ever had to one.

824
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:49,109
我生命中最美好的部分是虛偽的。
The best part of my life was fake.

825
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:52,946
你們都沒告訴我。
And none of you told me.

826
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,035
還有那些特工
And those agents

827
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,829
你用化學方法征服了全球？
you chemically subjugated around the globe?

828
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,458
那就是我。
That was me.

829
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:07,753
嗯。
Mmm.

830
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:12,633
而你，你逃出來了。
And you, you got out.

831
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,177
德雷科夫確保沒有人能逃脫。
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

832
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,055
你要說什麼嗎？
Are you gonna say anything?

833
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,601
沒有。
No.

834
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,062
別碰我。
Don't touch me.

835
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,399
葉蓮娜。
Yelena.

836
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:30,984
沒有。
No.

837
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,324
我不知道沒事沒事。
I had no idea. It's okay, it's okay.

838
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,368
我去和她談談。
I'll go talk to her.

839
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:57,928
我進來是因為我不想說話。
I came in here because I didn't want to talk.

840
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:00,764
好吧。
Okay.

841
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,934
我們... 我們只是坐著。
We, uh... We just sit.

842
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,274
我們只是坐著。
We just sit.

843
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:20,993
你要去哪兒？
Where are you going?

844
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,495
我自己來不行你活不下去的。
To do this myself. Don't. You won't survive.

845
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,998
我希望我能相信你在乎我。
I wish I could believe that you cared.

846
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,001
但你不是第一個拋棄我的母親。
But you're not even the first mother that abandoned me.

847
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,295
不，你不是被拋棄的。
No, you weren't abandoned.

848
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,422
你被一個程序選中了
You were selected by a program

849
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,507
評估嬰兒的基因潛能。
that assessed the genetic potential in infants.

850
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:47,144
我被帶走了？
I was taken?

851
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:51,064
我相信交易達成了，你的家人得到了回報。
I believe a bargain was struck, your family paid off.

852
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,109
但是你媽媽，她一直在找你。
But your mother, she never stopped looking for you.

853
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:57,196
她在那方面和你很像她是的
She was like you in that way. She was

854
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:58,906
無情的。
relentless.

855
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,283
她怎麼了？
What happened to her?

856
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,745
德雷科夫殺了她。
Dreykov had her killed.

857
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,874
她的存在威脅著要揭開紅屋的面紗。
Her existence threatened to uncover the Red Room.

858
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,336
一般來說，一個好奇的平民的行為
Normally, the actions of one curious civilian

859
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,504
不會被處決,
wouldn't warrant an execution,

860
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,381
但是，正如我所說，她是無情的。
but, as I said, she was relentless.

861
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,970
我生命中的每一天都在想她。
I thought about her every day of my life.

862
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:29,394
不管我自己承認與否，我都承認了。
Whether or not I admitted it to myself, I did.

863
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:34,233
我一直覺得最好不要回顧過去。
I've always found it best not to look into the past.

864
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,870
那你為什麼還留著這個？
Then why did you save this?

865
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,723
我記得這一天。
I remember this day.

866
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,853
我們在一天之內拍攝了聖誕節、感恩節、復活節和暑假。
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter and summer vacation all in one day.

867
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,480
不同的背景嗯。
Different backdrops. Mmm.

868
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,486
我知道樹下所有的禮物都是空盒子，但我不在乎。
I knew all the presents under the tree were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

869
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:21,321
我想打開每一個..。
I wanted to open every single one...

870
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,536
所以哪怕只有一秒鐘，感覺都是真實的。
so just for a second it would feel real.

871
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,496
讓我們停止這一切。
Let's stop this.

872
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,547
你為什麼要這麼做？
Why you doing this?

873
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:43,635
為什麼一隻出生在籠子裏的老鼠會跑在那個小輪子上？
Why does a mouse born in a cage run on that little wheel?

874
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,430
你知道我騎車經過紅房間嗎
Do you know I was cycled through the Red Room

875
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:49,099
在你出生前四次？
four times before you were even born?

876
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:50,684
我只知道那些牆。
Those walls are all I know.

877
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,687
我從來沒有選擇的餘地。
I was never given a choice.

878
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,398
但你不是老鼠，梅麗娜。
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

879
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:02,029
你只是出生在一個籠子裏，但這不是你的錯。
You were just born in a cage, but that's not your fault.

880
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,952
告訴我，你是如何保住你的心的？
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

881
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,085
痛苦只會讓我們更強大。
Pain only makes us stronger.

882
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,005
你沒告訴我們嗎？
Didn't you tell us that?

883
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,426
你教我的東西讓我活了下來。
What you taught me kept me alive.

884
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,140
對不起，我已經通知了紅房間。
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

885
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,267
他們隨時會到。
They'll be here any minute.

886
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:39,733
阿列克謝: 所以，我和我的父親在那裏冰上釣魚。
ALEXEI: So, there I am ice fishing with my father.

887
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,945
這個小冰棚裏的天氣很冷。
It's very cold day in this little ice shed.

888
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,404
即使對俄羅斯來說也很冷，你知道嗎？
Cold even for Russia, you know?

889
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,324
「把伏特加留在火爐邊,」父親會對我說。
"Keep the vodka by the fire," my father would say to me.

890
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,617
請不要說話。
Please stop talking.

891
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,743
請等一下，請等一下請不要。
Please wait. Please wait. Please, no.

892
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:50,827
求你了，我不想說話。
Please, I don't want to talk.

893
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,454
求你了求你了。
Please. Please.

01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,791
我告訴你這些是有原因的相信我。
There is a reason why I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

895
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,460
我正在抓魚。
I am reaching for fish.

896
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:02,923
哦! 我失去平衡了。啊！
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

897
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,007
撲通一聲！
Splash!

898
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,009
我的手伸到河裏去了
My hands go in the river.

899
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:10,180
在這種天氣裏，凍傷很快就會發作。
In this weather, frostbite sets in quick.

900
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,351
我父親，他在我手上上廁所。
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

901
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:15,644
天啊。
Oh, my God.

902
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:20,607
尿液是35攝氏度，延緩凍傷。
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius, staves off the frostbite.

903
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,276
這有什麼關係？
How is this relevant?

904
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,361
你知道,
You know,

905
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,154
父親。
fathers.

906
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:31,285
不不。
No. No.

907
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:35,455
你什麼也沒做，只是告訴我你有多無聊。
You have done nothing but tell me how bored you were.

908
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,835
我是個累贅，你不想做的工作。
I was the chore, the job you didn't want to do.

909
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,503
對我來說？
To me?

910
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,756
對我來說，你就是一切。
To me, you were everything.

911
01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:50,804
沒錯，你不在乎，你不在乎。
Exactly. You don't care. You don't care.

912
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:53,724
你唯一在乎的就是你那愚蠢的光輝歲月
The only thing you care about are your stupid glory days

913
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,144
就像深紅髮電機一樣，沒有人願意聽到這個消息。
as the Crimson Dynamo, and no one wants to hear about it.

914
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,652
是紅色衛報。
It's the Red Guardian.

915
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:06,904
出去。
Get out.

916
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:08,864
滾出去！
Get out!

917
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:20,876
我不記得了
I can't remember

918
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,881
如果我哭了
If I cried

919
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,678
當我讀到他的寡婦新娘的故事時
When I read about his widowed bride

920
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:36,934
有些東西深深地觸動了我的內心
Something touched me deep inside

921
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,268
那一天
The day

922
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:42,231
音樂
The music

923
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,483
死了
Died

924
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,694
他們在唱歌
And they were singing

925
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,906
再見再見
Bye Bye

926
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,659
美國派小姐美國派
Miss American Pie American Pie

927
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:56,745
把我的雪佛蘭開到堤壩上
Drove my Chevy to the levee

928
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,540
但堤壩是幹的是干的
But the levee was dry Was dry

929
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,459
他們都是好孩子
Them good old boys

930
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,962
喝威士忌
Drinking whiskey

931
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:07,881
唱歌
Singing

932
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,261
雙方: 「這將是一天，我死」
BOTH: "This will be the day that I die"

933
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,472
「就是這一天... ...」
"This'll be the day..."

934
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:36,368
趴下。
Get down.

935
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,210
他們認為..。
They think...

936
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:46,438
對不起。
I'm sorry.

937
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:49,858


938
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,540
別讓他久等了。
Let's not keep him waiting.

939
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,068
請求降落許可。
MELINA: Request clearance for landing.

940
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,655
梅麗娜？
Melina?

941
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,328
我們一分鐘後著陸。
We're touching down in one minute.

942
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:46,123
那我們為什麼還要上去？
Then why are we still going up?

943
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,795
現在你該知道這些年德雷科夫是怎麼躲過雷達的監視的了。
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed above the radar all these years.

944
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,709
德雷科夫: 我的天。
DREYKOV: My God.

945
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:18,382
那麼呃,
So, uh,

946
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,592
家庭聚會怎麼樣？
how was the family reunion?

947
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,636
太可怕了。
Oh, it was awful.

948
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:23,887
他們很粘人,
They were clingy,

949
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:26,098
而且太情緒化，太粘人了
and too emotional, and needy.

950
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:28,642
就像以前一樣?嗯。
Just like old times, huh? Hmm.

951
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,227
葉蓮娜 · 貝洛娃。
Yelena Belova.

952
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:32,104
她是怎麼回事？
What's the deal with her?

953
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,523
她是唯一一個受影響的，對嗎？
She was the only one affected, right?

954
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,233
據我所知，是的。
As far as I know, yes.

955
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,361
這些氣體和解毒劑,
These gasses and antidotes,

956
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:42,614
真讓我頭疼。
it's a pain in my ass.

957
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:46,159
這是個問題，你需要解決它。
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

958
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,578
嗯，我有九頭豬
Hmm. I have nine pigs

959
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,662
需要在我不在的時候處理。
that will require attending to in my absence.

960
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:52,040
別管你的豬了。
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

961
01:28:58,255 --> 01:28:59,506
把她的腦袋挖出來。
Cut her brain out...

962
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:03,010
找出弱點。
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

963
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:15,105
這種死法就沒那麼酷了。
This is a much less cool way to die.

964
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:22,863


965
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,490
男名男子名。
Alexei.

966
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,001
梅麗娜: 那羅曼諾夫呢？
MELINA: What about Romanoff?

967
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,461
她是個叛徒。
She's a traitor.

968
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:42,424
她背叛了她的人民，背叛了她的血統。
She turned her back on her people. On her blood.

969
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,344
她一無所有。
She had nothing.

970
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:49,306
我給了她家我給了她愛。
I gave her home. I gave her love.

971
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,100
把你做的那個東西放進她體內。
Put that thing in her you do.

972
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,353
你知道，化學藥品。
You know, uh, chemicals.

973
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:58,524
把她變成你的豬。
Turn her into one of your pigs.

974
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,654
你能想像我能控制一個復仇者做什麼嗎？
Can you imagine what I could do with an Avenger under my control?

975
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,281
你不想先和她談談嗎？
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

976
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:09,868
當你看著你撫養長大的孩子的眼睛,
When you look into the eyes of a child you have raised,

977
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,413
世界上任何面具都無法掩蓋這一點。
no mask in the world can hide that.

978
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:28,470
歡迎回家。
Welcome home.

979
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,140
現在，現在。
Now, now.

980
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,602
別把我的新玩具弄壞了。
Don't go breaking my new toy.

981
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,772
娜塔莎。
Natasha.

982
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:42,943
我救不了我們。
I can't save us.

983
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,737
我想讓你知道我很抱歉。
I need you to know that I'm sorry.

984
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:47,781
我為了一個目標而獻出了生命。
I pledged my life to a cause.

985
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:50,284
我以為我很勇敢。
You know, I thought I was being very brave.

986
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,577
可能是最勇敢的。
Possibly the bravest.

987
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:54,246
但我並不勇敢。
But I wasn't being brave.

988
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:55,956
我是個懦夫。
I was coward.

989
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:03,213
在古巴,
In Cuba,

990
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:07,050
當他們把你從我身邊帶走的時候..。
when they came and took you away from me...

991
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,929
沒有任何理由值得你這麼做。
No cause is worth that.

992
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,851
你只應該犧牲你自己
You should only sacrifice yourself

993
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,270
為了什麼...
for something...

994
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,988
你是怎麼做到的？
How did you do that?

995
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,033
這些細胞是我自己設計的。
I designed these cells myself.

996
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:35,412
什麼？
What?

997
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:38,248
什麼？
What?

998
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:42,127
我向你袒露了我的靈魂，而你一直都是我的唯一？
I bared my soul to you and it was just you the whole time?

999
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:45,881
是的，恐怕是這樣。但是，等等，噓，我在和葉琳娜通話。
Yes, I'm afraid so. But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1000
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,051
葉蓮娜，是我，媽媽。
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

1001
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:52,179
你的腰帶裏藏著一把兩英吋長的刀片。
You have a twoinch blade concealed in your beltline.

1002
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:53,347
什麼？
What?

1003
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,519
你要對我做什麼？
What are you going to do to me?

1004
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:00,854
梅麗娜: 右臀外側。
MELINA: Outside right hip.

1005
01:32:07,402 --> 01:32:08,904


1006
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,217
你就不能早點告訴我嗎？
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1007
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,385
梅麗娜: 不要大發雷霆。
MELINA: Don't throw a fit.

1008
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:32,845
沒時間了好了姑娘們,
There wasn't time. Okay, girls,

1009
01:32:32,928 --> 01:32:34,179
我聽不清你說什麼,
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1010
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:37,140
但是，娜塔莎，有些事情我需要你知道。
but, Natasha, there's something I need you to know.

1011
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:41,979
我要你知道我很抱歉別再找借口了好嗎？
I need you to know that I'm sorry. No more excuses, okay?

1012
01:32:42,646 --> 01:32:45,566
我為了事業獻出了生命，我以為我很勇敢。
I gave my life for a cause. I thought I was being brave.

1013
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,776
你沒有耳機。
You don't have earpiece.

1014
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:49,486
什麼？
What?

1015
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:50,779
不，她聽不見。
No, she can't hear you.

1016
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:52,364
你沒有耳機為什麼？
You don't have earpiece. Why not?

1017
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:53,824
因為這不是計劃的一部分。
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1018
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:55,534
哦，是嗎? 那麼，你的計劃是什麼？
Oh, yeah? Well, what was the plan?

1019
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:57,327
娜塔莎: 那麼，一旦我們進去了,
NATASHA: So, once we're inside,

1020
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:58,996
我激活我的追蹤器，羅斯就會跑過來。
I'll activate my tracker and Ross will come running.

1021
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:02,666
你知道你仍然是一個全球性的逃犯，是嗎？
You are aware that you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1022
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,627
你瞭解這個設施，一定有辦法讓它著陸。
You know the facility. There must be some way to land it.

1023
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:10,090
讓他們把我們關在零層。
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1024
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:12,926
一旦我出去了我就可以啟動著陸協議,
Once I'm out, I can activate the landing protocol,

1025
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,511
我們可以在一小時內降落。
we can descend within the hour.

1026
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,263
啊有問題。
Ah, problem.

1027
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,016
我只有一個耳機。
I only have one earpiece set.

1028
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:20,934
我會把它交給葉蓮娜。
I'll give it to Yelena.

1029
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:22,686
他把藥瓶帶到哪裏去了？
Where did he take the vials?

1030
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:24,771
梅麗娜: 可能去冷藏室了。
MELINA: Probably down to cold storage.

1031
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,274
德雷科夫仍然控制著寡婦們,
Dreykov still has the widows under his control,

1032
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:30,027
所以你必須讓他們接觸解毒劑。
so you have to expose them to this antidote.

1033
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:33,405
是的，當然，放鬆。
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1034
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:35,908
這就是你的計劃嗎？
Is this your plan?

1035
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:37,701
我的計劃是殺了你。
My plan is to kill you.

1036
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:39,286
我還活著。
I'm alive.

1037
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,122
那我們現在怎麼辦？
So, what do we do now?

1038
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,501
我母親叫什麼名字？
What was my mother's name?

1039
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,172
啊..。
Ah...

1040
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,342
我們埋葬她的地方,
Where we buried her,

1041
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:55,844
有一棵樹..。
there was a tree...

1042
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,888
嗯..。
Um...

1043
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,848
一朵粉紅色的花。
A pink blossom.

1044
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,725
真漂亮。
Beautiful.

1045
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:03,644
還有一塊墓碑
And there was a tombstone

1046
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,438
上面刻著她的名字。
with her name engraved on it.

1047
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:08,732
她叫什麼名字？
What was her name?

1048
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:16,031
「未知。」
"Unknown."

1049
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:20,369
你什麼都感覺不到嗎？
You don't feel anything?

1050
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,914
我殺你女兒的時候你有什麼感覺嗎？
You feel anything when I killed your daughter?

1051
01:34:24,081 --> 01:34:27,334
這就是你鬧鬼的過去嗎？
Is this your haunted past?

1052
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:43,642
謝謝你，娜塔莎。
Thank you, Natasha.

1053
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:50,482
你給了我最強大的武器。
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1054
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:55,320
打個招呼。
Say hello.

1055
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:13,005
當你的炸彈爆炸時,
When your bomb exploded,

1056
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,716
它差點殺了我的安東妮亞。
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1057
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:23,307
我不得不在她脖子後面植入芯片。
I had to put a chip in the back of her neck.

1058
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:25,809
在她脖子後面。
In the back of her neck.

1059
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:28,187
看看她。
Look at her.

1060
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,898
你覺得看著她很難受嗎？
You find it difficult to look at her?

1061
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,150
我知道。
I do.

1062
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,653
她... 她什麼都看
She... She watches everything

1063
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:38,739
她能做到。
and she can do it.

1064
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,325
她是個完美的模仿者。
She's a perfect mimic.

1065
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,246
她就像你所有的朋友一樣打架。
And she fights just like all of your friends.

1066
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:52,503
她能聽見我說話嗎？
Can she hear me?

1067
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,090
什麼？
What?

1068
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:01,303
你想讓她好受點嗎？
You want to make her feel better?

1069
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,933
你想告訴她你很抱歉嗎？
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1070
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:11,146
在你打爆她的臉之前你就該想到這一點。
Well, you should have thought of that before you blew her face off.

1071
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:15,692
但是這些廢話已經夠多了。
But enough of all this bullshit.

1072
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:18,153
去工作吧。
Go to work.

1073
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,364
地下室有老鼠，快去。
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1074
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:24,159
去吧。
Go.

1075
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,339
那是個錯誤。
Well, that was a mistake.

1076
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:39,091
是嗎？
Was it?

1077
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:42,636
你剛剛送走了唯一能阻止我殺你的東西。
You just sent away the one thing that would stop me from killing you.

1078
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:45,389
那就試試吧。
Try, then.

1079
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:46,765
動手吧。
Do it.

1080
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:53,063
保險開著嗎？
Is the safety on?

1081
01:36:58,151 --> 01:36:59,152
沒有。
No.

1082
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,825
試試你的刀
Try your knife.

1083
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:06,785
德雷科夫: 啊... ..。
DREYKOV: Ah...

1084
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:14,877
你有麻煩了。
You're in trouble.

1085
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:16,378
你是怎麼控制我的？
How are you controlling me?

1086
01:37:16,545 --> 01:37:18,589
我沒有控制你，娜塔莎。
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1087
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:20,632
好吧，還沒有。
Well, not yet.

1088
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:23,427
但是有一種信息素鎖。
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1089
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,182
聞到我的信息素，你就不會對我動粗了。
Smelling my pheromones prevents you from committing violence against me.

1090
01:37:32,728 --> 01:37:35,397
我很生梅麗娜的氣。
I'm very upset with Melina.

1091
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:37,441
真遺憾我不得不殺了她。
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1092
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:39,776
拜託，如果我們只是想
ALEXEI: Come on, now. If we're just going to

1093
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,695
按下按鈕，黑進電腦..。
press buttons and hack computers...

1094
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:42,863
是的我是說，我不知道。
MELINA: Yes. ALEXEI: I mean, I don't know.

1095
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:43,947
我無能為力。
There's nothing for me to do.

1096
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,867
我想... 我想打碎什麼東西。
I want to... I want to break something.

1097
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,951
是嗎?是的
Oh, you do?

1098
01:37:49,703 --> 01:37:52,331
有東西是可以打破的。
Oh, there is something you can break.

1099
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,932
Melina 如果這是我們最後一次..。
Melina, if this is the last time that we...

1100
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,769
該死。
Ah, damn it.

1101
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:28,575
太噁心了。
That was disgusting.

1102
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:43,131
好吧。
Okay.

1103
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,656
這就是你的大計劃？
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1104
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:12,870
梅麗娜準備降落在紅房間，把我交給當局。
Melina was going to land the Red Room and hand me over to the authorities.

1105
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:17,708
不不不。
Oh, no, no, no.

1106
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:26,550
那麼，現在怎麼辦，你要把我捲進你那可悲的木偶戲裏嗎？
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1107
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:27,718
真可悲，是吧？
Pathetic, huh?

1108
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,553
是啊，你會怎麼說？
Yeah, what would you call it?

1109
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,888
我會稱之為...最後一次
I would call it... When was the last time

1110
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:32,347
你和某人談過話
that you had a conversation with somebody

1111
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,266
不是被迫跟你說話的人嗎？
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1112
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:37,394
你跑去打一場錯誤的戰爭。
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1113
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:41,315
真正的戰爭是在這裏打的，在暗處。
The real war was fought here, in the shadows.

1114
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:43,066
你沒有在暗處戰鬥。
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1115
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:44,443
你躲在黑暗中。
You hid in the dark.

1116
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,405
真正的力量來自於無法察覺的影響力。
Real power comes from undetectable influence.

1117
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:50,991
如果沒有人注意到，那為什麼還要這麼做呢？
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1118
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:52,492
你什麼都不是。
You're nothing.

1119
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:54,786
嗯你什麼都沒有。
Hmm. You have nothing.

1120
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:56,872
這個星球上有50個人..。
There are 50 people on this planet...

1121
01:39:57,039 --> 01:39:58,290
別說了。
Oh, stop it.

1122
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,084
別叫我停下來！
Don't tell me to stop!

1123
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,171
如果我不告訴你什麼時候該停止，那麼你怎麼知道什麼時候該閉嘴呢？
If I don't tell you when to stop, then how will you know when to shut up?

1124
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,259
來吧。
Come on.

1125
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:11,261
你以為我挨不了一拳？
Think I can't take a punch?

1126
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,429
哦
DREYKOV: Oh.

1127
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:17,434
該死的你太軟弱了軟弱？
God damn it, you're weak. Weak?

1128
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,770
我打賭在毫無防備的小女孩面前強硬起來會更容易，對吧？
I bet it's easier to be tough in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1129
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,563
夠了
DREYKOV: That's enough.

1130
01:40:31,657 --> 01:40:33,283
德雷科夫: 你不會這麼油嘴滑舌
DREYKOV: You wouldn't be so glib

1131
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:37,120
如果你知道我建造了什麼的話。
if you had any notion of the scope of what I've built.

1132
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,333
我擁有這個世界，我。
I own this world. Me.

1133
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,252
你似乎不顧一切地想給我留下好印象。
You seem desperate to impress me.

1134
01:40:43,418 --> 01:40:44,753
我不需要給你留下深刻印象。
I don't need to impress you.

1135
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,422
我不需要給任何人留下好印象。
I don't need to impress anyone.

1136
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:51,802
這些世界領袖，這些偉人,
These world leaders, these great men,

1137
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,472
她們聽命於我和我的寡婦們。
they answer to me and my widows.

1138
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:00,310
看看他們。
Look at them.

1139
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:04,815
這些女孩都是垃圾。
These girls were trash.

1140
01:41:05,941 --> 01:41:08,026
他們被扔到街上。
They are thrown out into the street.

1141
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:11,780
我回收垃圾。
I recycle the trash.

1142
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:13,824
我給了他們目標。
And I give them purpose.

1143
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,452
我給了他們生活。
I give them a life.

1144
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:26,920
梅琳娜，我找到那些瓶子的位置了。
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1145
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:30,299
梅麗娜: 我遇到了一點小挫折。
MELINA: I've had a slight setback.

1146
01:41:32,384 --> 01:41:34,094
你得去找那些寡婦。
You'll need to get to the widows.

1147
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:55,199
德雷科夫: 這是我的寡婦網
DREYKOV: It's my network of widows

1148
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:58,410
幫助我控制權力的天平。
that help me control the scales of power.

1149
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:02,831
一個命令，石油和股票市場崩潰。
One command, the oil and stock markets crumble.

1150
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:07,085
只要一個命令，地球上四分之一的人就會挨餓。
One command, and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1151
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:10,380
我的寡婦們可以發動和結束戰爭。
My widows can start and end wars.

1152
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:13,342
他們可以製造國王，也可以摧毀國王。
They can make and break kings.

1153
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:19,890
你在這裏控制一切？
You control all of that from here?

1154
01:42:20,641 --> 01:42:22,518
和你在一起,
And with you,

1155
01:42:23,185 --> 01:42:26,230
一個由我控制的復仇者,
an Avenger under my control,

1156
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:30,067
我終於可以走出陰影了
I can finally come out of the shadows

1157
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:35,948
利用世界上僅有的自然資源。
using the only natural resource that the world has too much of.

1158
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:38,909
女孩們。
Girls.

1159
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:51,588
都是從那個小控制台？
All from that little console?

1160
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:53,549
德雷科夫: 是的。
DREYKOV: Yeah.

1161
01:42:57,886 --> 01:42:59,638
你覺得這很好笑嗎？
Oh, you find this amusing?

1162
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,473
你笑什麼？
Why are you smiling?

1163
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,184
不是針對你但是..。
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1164
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,564
謝謝你的合作。
Thank you for your cooperation.

1165
01:43:09,022 --> 01:43:13,235
即使你找到了數據庫讓他給你看鑰匙,
Even if you locate the database and get him to show you the key,

1166
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:15,946
你不能從他那裏拿走。
you won't be able to take it from him.

1167
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:19,491
多年來，德雷科夫實施了一種信息素鎖
For years, Dreykov has implemented a pheromonal lock

1168
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:21,493
所有的寡婦，包括我。
in all widows, even me.

1169
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,248
所以，只要我們能聞到他的氣味，我們就不能傷害他。
So, as long as we can smell him, then we won't be able to hurt him.

1170
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:28,041
我還是屏住呼吸吧。
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1171
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:29,668
還不夠。
Not enough.

1172
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:31,545
這是基礎科學。
This is basic science.

1173
01:43:31,712 --> 01:43:34,965
娜塔莎，為了阻斷嗅覺中樞的受體,
Natasha, to block receptors in olfactory center,

1174
01:43:35,132 --> 01:43:37,176
你必須切斷神經。
you have to sever the nerve.

1175
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:40,345
我能搞定。
I can handle that.

1176
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:43,640
你不夠強壯所以..。
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1177
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,268
我得自己完成它。
I'll have to finish it myself.

1178
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:48,395
你打算怎麼辦？
What are you going to do?

1179
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:51,648
切斷神經。
Sever the nerve.

1180
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:16,465
梅麗娜！
Melina!

1181
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:29,394
這正是我所想的。
Precisely what I was thinking.

1182
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:43,867
葉蓮娜，計劃有點小變動。
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1183
01:44:44,034 --> 01:44:47,329
我徹底摧毀了其中一個引擎，我們即將墜毀。
I completely demolished one of the engines and we are going into a controlled crash.

1184
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:51,375
葉琳娜: 太棒了。
YELENA: Fantastic.

1185
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,043
我現在去找寡婦們。
I'm heading to the widows now.

1186
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:55,546
沒有。
No.

1187
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,751
梅麗娜: 我們得走了。
MELINA: We have to go.

1188
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,718
你現在不太愛說話了，是嗎？
Not so talkative now, are you?

1189
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:45,470
你奪走了我的童年。
You took my childhood.

1190
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:49,641
你奪走了我的選擇，試圖擊垮我。
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1191
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,852
但你再也不能這樣對待任何人了。
But you're never gonna do that to anybody ever again.

1192
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,867
德雷科夫: 在她死之前，任何人不得離開這個房間。
DREYKOV: Nobody leaves this room until she's dead.

1193
01:46:07,034 --> 01:46:09,203
讓她痛苦。
Make her suffer.

1194
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:12,831
我不想傷害你。
I don't wanna hurt you.

1195
01:46:13,415 --> 01:46:14,833
你不想傷害我。
You don't wanna hurt me.

1196
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:10,073
嘿。
YELENA: Hey.

1197
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:11,450
你還好嗎？
Are you okay?

1198
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:13,869
看起來好像很疼。
That looks like it hurts.

1199
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:16,246
好，我數到三就開槍，準備好了嗎？
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1200
01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:18,415
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1201
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:26,173
離開這裏越遠越好。
Get as far away from here as possible.

1202
01:48:27,132 --> 01:48:28,717
你現在可以自己做決定了。
You get to make your own choices now.

1203
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,979
我們得離開這裏。
We gotta get outta here.

1204
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:42,231
我們得找到德雷科夫，你來嗎？
We need to find Dreykov. Are you coming?

1205
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:43,524
我就在你後面。
I'm right behind you.

1206
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,534
等等，等等，我得回去！
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1207
01:49:13,887 --> 01:49:14,972


1208
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,825
太好了！
Yes!

1209
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,509
你看到那些女孩了嗎？
Do you see the girls?

1210
01:50:36,386 --> 01:50:37,387
不！
No!

1211
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:11,839
我們得回去。
We need to go back.

1212
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:40,784
我們失去控制了。
MELINA: We've lost control.

1213
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:06,310
女名女子名。
Antonia.

1214
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:14,318
我去開門。
I'm gonna open the door.

1215
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,945
你會來找我的。
You're gonna come after me.

1216
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:19,323
沒事了，沒事了。
It's okay. It's okay.

1217
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,619
我知道你還在裏面。
I know you're still in there.

1218
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:28,457
我不會離開你的好嗎。
And I'm not gonna leave you. Okay.

1219
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:43,866
葉蓮娜！
Yelena!

1220
01:53:45,409 --> 01:53:46,910
她在機翼上！
She's on the wing!

1221
01:53:47,077 --> 01:53:49,454
快走! 你們還在等什麼？
Move! What are you waiting for?

1222
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:51,999
別這麼做！
Don't do it!

1223
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:54,626
這很有趣！
This was fun!

1224
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:55,836
不！
No!

1225
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:45,320
好吧。
Okay.

1226
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,031
我們走。
Let's go.

1227
01:56:02,838 --> 01:56:04,089
夠了。
Enough.

1228
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:56,892
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1229
01:56:57,059 --> 01:56:58,477
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1230
01:57:01,688 --> 01:57:03,273
他走了嗎？
Is he gone?

1231
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:09,071
他走了。
He's gone.

1232
01:57:26,713 --> 01:57:28,090
葉蓮娜！
Yelena!

1233
01:57:38,934 --> 01:57:40,227
葉蓮娜？
Yelena?

1234
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:49,152
我們都是顛倒的。
We're both upside down.

1235
01:58:04,168 --> 01:58:05,460
我應該回來找你的。
I should've come back for you.

1236
01:58:05,627 --> 01:58:06,795
你不用這麼說。
You don't have to say that.

1237
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:08,172
沒事的嘿嘿。
It's okay. Hey. Hey.

1238
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:10,299
這對我來說也是真實的。
It was real to me, too.

1239
01:58:24,563 --> 01:58:25,564
葉琳娜: 謝謝。
YELENA: Thank you.

1240
01:58:40,662 --> 01:58:41,788
大家都好嗎？
Everybody good?

1241
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:44,374
我明顯受傷了。
I am clearly injured.

1242
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,711
你有話要說嗎？
You got something to say?

1243
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:50,088
我只會把事情搞砸。
I'd just mess it up.

1244
01:59:04,436 --> 01:59:06,355
騎兵來了。
Here comes the cavalry.

1245
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,777
我們正在接近目標，長官。
We're closing in on the target, sir.

1246
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:16,448
我們的計劃是什麼？
So, what's our plan?

1247
01:59:17,366 --> 01:59:19,952
你們去吧我留下。
You guys go. I'll stay.

1248
01:59:20,118 --> 01:59:22,079
這太瘋狂了，我們打架，我們和你一起打架。
That's insanity. We fight. We fight with you.

1249
01:59:22,162 --> 01:59:24,039
娜塔莎: 我來拖住他們。阿列克謝: 娜塔莎，我們戰鬥。
NATASHA: I'll hold them off. ALEXEI: Natasha, we fight.

1250
01:59:24,122 --> 01:59:25,666
梅麗娜: 我們不能分開。你太固執了。
MELINA: We can't split up. You're so pigheaded.

1251
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,001
娜塔莎: 你們快走天啊。
NATASHA: You guys, go. Oh, my God.

1252
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:30,921
而且如果我們四個能成功的話,
Besides, if it can work out with the four of us, you know,

1253
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:33,507
復仇者聯盟或許還有希望。
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1254
01:59:33,674 --> 01:59:34,967
一點點。
Little bit.

1255
01:59:35,133 --> 01:59:39,054
好吧，如果你要走的話，我想你應該拿著這個。
Okay, well, if you're leaving, then I guess you should take this.

1256
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,765
我知道你有多喜歡。
I know how much you like it.

1257
01:59:41,932 --> 01:59:43,725
娜塔莎: 胡說
NATASHA: Shucks.

1258
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,060
它確實有很多口袋。
It does have a lot of pockets.

1259
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:47,229
非常方便的口袋。
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1260
01:59:48,355 --> 01:59:50,524
他在世界各地植入了寡婦。
He had widows implanted all over the world.

1261
01:59:50,691 --> 01:59:52,568
梅麗娜需要複製分子式,
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1262
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,903
但你應該告訴他們一切都結束了。
but you should be the one to tell 'em it's over.

1263
02:00:14,756 --> 02:00:16,675
你回來救我們了。
You came back for us.

1264
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,810
謝謝你。
Thank you.

1265
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:33,108
梅麗娜: 嘿。
MELINA: Hey.

1266
02:00:33,775 --> 02:00:36,570
照顧好自己，好嗎？
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1267
02:00:36,737 --> 02:00:37,863
別擔心，我來處理。
Don't worry. I got this.

1268
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,489
我知道。
I know.

1269
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,794
梅麗娜: 別擔心，我們會帶她一起去的。
MELINA: Don't worry. We're bringing her with us.

1270
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,797
來，跟我們走。
Come. Come with us.

1271
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:31,602
你從來不睡覺嗎？
You ever not sleep?

1272
02:02:32,769 --> 02:02:36,148
因為你，我在三天內穿越了六個時區。
I've been in six different time zones in three days because of you.

1273
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:37,608
真的嗎?是的。
Oh, really? Yeah.

1274
02:02:37,774 --> 02:02:40,235
什麼，你是在拆零件嗎？
What, are you scrapping together some parts?

1275
02:02:40,402 --> 02:02:43,947
這次你給我買了什麼，一台倒置的割草機？
What'd you get me this time, like, an upsidedown lawnmower?

1276
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,413
你看我花點時間和金錢就能給你弄到什麼？
You see what I can get you with a bit of time and money?

1277
02:02:57,419 --> 02:02:59,046
說啊，我想聽。
Go on, say it. I wanna hear it.

1278
02:02:59,213 --> 02:03:01,840
聽到這些對我來說真的很好，真的。
It would really be good for me to hear it. Really.

1279
02:03:03,091 --> 02:03:04,259
真讓我印象深刻。
I'm impressed.

1280
02:03:04,426 --> 02:03:06,094
是啊。
Well, yeah.

1281
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,348
你一直是我的好朋友。
You've always been a really good friend to me.

1282
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,017
這是每個男人都想聽到的。
That's what every man wants to hear.

1283
02:03:12,809 --> 02:03:13,977
你要去哪裏？
Where you gonna go?

1284
02:03:15,312 --> 02:03:17,981
真有意思，我這一輩子都以為自己沒有家人。
It's funny. My whole life, I didn't think I had any family.

1285
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:20,317
結果我有兩個所以..。
Turns out I got two, so...

1286
02:03:20,817 --> 02:03:22,110
其中一個現在有點亂。
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1287
02:03:22,277 --> 02:03:25,072
我要把他們中的幾個從監獄裏救出來
I'm gonna go break a few of them out of prison

1288
02:03:25,572 --> 02:03:28,075
看看我能不能幫上忙。
see if I can't help patch things up.

1289
02:12:39,585 --> 02:12:41,920
我對中西部過敏。
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1290
02:12:44,423 --> 02:12:47,259
這個女人的所作所為,
What this woman did,

1291
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:50,262
說實話我都不敢想像。
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1292
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,516
你不應該在我的假期打擾我，瓦倫蒂娜。
You're not supposed to be bothering me on my holiday time, Valentina.

1293
02:12:54,683 --> 02:12:56,185
哦，打擾你了? 哦，不，不。
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1294
02:12:56,268 --> 02:12:58,812
我只是來表達我的敬意。
I'm just here paying my respects.

1295
02:12:58,896 --> 02:12:59,980
嗯... ..。
YELENA: Hmm...

1296
02:13:00,397 --> 02:13:02,691
來這裏讓你看起來很絕望。
You know, coming here makes you look desperate.

1297
02:13:06,028 --> 02:13:07,070
好吧。
Okay.

1298
02:13:07,237 --> 02:13:08,322
我要加薪。
I want a raise.

1299
02:13:08,488 --> 02:13:09,823
哦，是的，你和我都是。
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1300
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,451
相信我，這是你應得的。
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1301
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:15,913
我找到你的下一個目標了。
I've got your next target.

1302
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:17,831
我想親手交給你。
Thought I'd handdeliver it.

1303
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:24,880
也許你想殺了那個害死你妹妹的人。
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man responsible for your sister's death.

1304
02:13:27,633 --> 02:13:29,593
挺可愛的，你不覺得嗎？
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
