530
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:06,665
Ooowee.

531
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,800
Never got my job
at the university back.

532
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,336
Remember that?
Rick made me do karate.

533
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,738
It -- It was kinda funny.

534
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,074
But I guess things
went downhill from there.

535
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:17,342
Started isolating myself
from Amy.

536
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,611
Used to tell her
everything I was feeling,

537
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,080
but then I guess I stopped,

538
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,682
'cause I wanted her to love
who she thought I was,

539
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,884
not who I felt myself becoming.

540
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,553
Ever think about how horrified
the people we love would be

541
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,622
if they found out
who we truly are?

542
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,425
So we just dig ourselves deeper
into our lies every day,

543
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:38,029
ultimately hurting the only
people brave enough to love us.

544
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:39,631
Wish I didn't do that.

545
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,767
Wish I was brave enough
to love them back.

546
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:44,636
I don't know.
Maybe you should try it.

547
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,838
We don't have as much time
as we think.

548
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,040
Ooowee.

549
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,310
Man:
Did you get any of that?
