1
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,672
According to Salvor,
the engine room is that way.

2
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,180
We've got about thirty-three hours
to disable the jumpdrives.

3
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,768
What happened here?

4
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,190
A long and terrible story
that no one's alive to tellâ€¦

5
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:39,858
Anacreons, where?

6
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:44,530
The bridge.
Salvor has them tied up in there.

7
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:46,573
All clear.

8
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,528
Did you find the Huntress?

9
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,279
We searched the entire ship.

10
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,864
No sign of her.

11
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,742
Except this.

12
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,663
Then we get down to Terminus
as fast as possible.

13
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,583
Obsidian, open a channel
to Arkose and Gneiss.

14
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,127
Communications channel open.

15
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,672
This is Thespin Command.

16
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:26,426
I want all lancers planet-side
immediately.
