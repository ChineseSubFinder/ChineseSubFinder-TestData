00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,700
他很健全且狂野
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He is unbroken. Untamed.

126
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,390
或许我们应该把牵绳拉紧一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Perhaps he could use a firmer grip upon his leash.

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,870
好  够了  我要报警了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, that's enough. I'm calling the police.

128
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,050
-没问题  -杰瑞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Go ahead.  -Jerry.

129
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,590
-我真的会  -我能控制警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-I will! Good.  -I control them.

130
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,920
-什么  -能控制警察  杰瑞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Excuse me?  -He controls police, Jerry.

131
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,510
对  我如果会相信就太蠢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right, that tracks. In Dumb World.

132
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,140
警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Police?

133
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,800
有个淫荡海男在我家门口
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A strange horny ocean man is on my lawn.

134
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,760
这应该不重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I don't see how that's relevant,

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,700
但我们是白人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but we're white.

136
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,630
不许动  不许动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,890
打架
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fight.

138
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,420
做爱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

139
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,680
离开  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Flee. Let's get outta here.

140
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,730
-来吧  理查德  -他怎么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Shall we, Richard?  -Okay, but how did he --

141
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,340
天啊  杰瑞  他是宁波先生  他能控制警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's Mr. Nimbus. He controls the police!

142
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,260
你们好  是我走错地方了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Um, hello? Am I in the right place?

143
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,610
我刚刚看到一群警察在做爱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just saw a bunch of cops having sex with each other?

144
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,740
杰西卡  你好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi! Jessica! Hi!

145

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is everybody. Uh, this is --

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,790
-我是宁波先生  -宁波  进来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-I am Mr. Nimbus.  -Jesus, Nimbus, just get inside.

149
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,880
莫蒂  去拿酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Morty, grab the wine.

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
好  等一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, in a minute.

151
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
进来吧  杰西卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}C-C'mon, Jessica.

152
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,320
让开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stand aside.

153
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,320
除非你们配得上宁波
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Unless you are worthy of Nimbus.

154
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,320
如果你指的是那个意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If that means what I think it means,

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,760
我可以告诉你  我们会一起看片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll have you know, we watch porn together.

156
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,460
天啊  宁波先生对你们点头了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wow, okay! Looks like you guys just got the nod.

157
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,640
点头咋了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The nod?

158
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,120
宁波先生直觉很准
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Nimbus has a sense for these things.

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,990
你们应该是性积极的夫妇吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I take it you're a sex-positive couple?

160
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,950
对  非常积极
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, yeah. Very much so.

161
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,340
我们会一起看片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We watch porn together. Great!

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,950
很好  那我就帮你们登记三人行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll mark you down as eligible for a threeway.

163
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,510
这是相关资料
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Here's all the information you'll need.

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,300
海王想跟我们三人行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The king of the ocean wants to have a threesome with us?

165
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,870
决定权在你们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Totally optional.

166
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,040
不过机会难得  我保证  我很嫉妒你们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But a remarkable option to have, I assure you. Very jealous.

167
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,310
最后一页有表单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a form on the last page

168
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,310
请填写收礼物篮的地址
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so we know where to send the gift basket.

169
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,350
竟然有这种事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So that just happened.

170
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
你好像不排斥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't sound upset about it.

171
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,140
你也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Neither do you.

172
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,710
天啊  我们真的遇到这种事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God. Is this happening? To us?

173
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,490
我以为这种事只会在纽约或HBO上发生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought this only happened in New York or on HBO.

174
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,970
王医师一向都是对的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dr. Wong hasn't been wrong yet.

175
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,320
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're right.

176
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,180
这就是她想要我们做的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is exactly what she was talking about.

177
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,500
你可以当自己家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, uh, yeah. J-Just make yourself comfortable.

178
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,500

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,020
跨维度有线电视
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}some interdimensional cable if you want.

180
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,900
请继续收看任天堂69
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We now return to "Nintendo 69."

181
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,030
任天堂  你在干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nintendo, oh, what are you doing to me?

182
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,680
任天堂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, Nintendo, oh, Nin--

183
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,250
或者我们也可以看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or we can watch whatever, y'know.

184
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,510
你想看的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wh-Whatever you're into.

185
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,560
莫蒂  你是不是要负责拿酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Morty, did I hear you're getting wine?

186
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,780
对  我得端酒给宁波先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I gotta get some wine for Mr. Nimbus.

187
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,000
有多的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Got any extra?

188
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,690
当然
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh. Uh, yeah.

189
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,580

快点回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hurry back.

191
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,400
看来你好像需要帮忙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Looks like you could use a hand.

192
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
对  太好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, hey! Yeah, th-th-that'd be great.

195
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,230
我先帮年轻人把这些
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just helping this young man through a portal

196
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,890
放了好几十年的酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with that crate full of alcohol

197
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,190

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that's been here for decades.

谢了  小蹄  谢谢你的帮忙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, thanks, Hoovy. I-I really appreciate that.

199
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,720
有个女生来我家  我很喜欢她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-I got a girl over, and I really, really like her.

200
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,110
-我只是很紧张  -我懂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-I-I'm just nervous.  -Oh, I know that feeling.

201
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,720
我刚开始跟波娃交往时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When I first started seeing Bova,

202
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,770
我满脑子都担心自己会搞砸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could only think about all the ways I was gonna mess it up.

203
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,470
-后来怎么办的  -我搞砸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-So what'd you do?  -Oh, I messed it up.

204
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,560
但我找到了能接纳我这点的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I found the one who loves me for that.

205
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,560
谢谢  我需要你的鼓励
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks. I-I really needed to hear that.

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,740
-来  拿一瓶走吧  -不用了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Here, -t-take one of these.  -Oh, you don't have to.

207
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,390
不  我坚持  祝你今天愉快  小蹄
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I-I want to. You have a good day, Hoovy.

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,260
祝你跟那个女生玩得开心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have a great time with that lady up there.

209
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,900
-放轻松  -没问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Just relax.  -Will do!

210
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,050
波娃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bova?

211
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,230
你为什么离开我们  爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why did you leave us, Father?

212
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,750
贾费  你什么时候出生的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Japheth? When were you born?

213
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,840
我向妈妈发过誓  只要遇到你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I swore to Mother if I ever met you,

214
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,060
就会为她复仇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd avenge her.

215
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
不是我的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It wasn't my fault.

216
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,110
那是谁的错  是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whose, then? Whose?!

217
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,760
从魔法门来的那个男孩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The boy from the magic door.

218
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,070
我们来讨论条约内容吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shall we discuss terms?

219
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,640
好  没问题  内容
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, fine. Whatever. Terms.

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,940
如下  第一条  我是海王
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Term number one -- I am King of the Ocean.

221
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,420

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,770
第二条  别在海里拉屎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Term number two -- Stop shitting in the ocean.

223
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,910
我听不懂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No idea what you're talking about.

224
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,600
真好喝  再来一瓶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Delicious. Another.

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,120
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ!

241
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,120
为什么每个老人都这么壮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why -- Why is every old guy super jacked?

242
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,560
抱歉  我很抱歉

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}M-Mother?

376
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,020
杰西卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jessica!

377
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,500
你就是非碰海不可
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You just had to touch the ocean.

378
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,850
闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Aaah! Shut up!

379
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,120
我没时间...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There isn't time to --

380
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,550
全都搞砸了  被你搞砸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's all fucked! And you fucked it!

381
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,910
你来太早了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're early.

382
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,690
这是哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}W-What is this place?

383
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,350
是终点  也是起点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The end. But also a beginning.

384
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,440
-每个终点都是起点  对吧  -后退
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Isn't every end a beginning?  -Stay back!

385
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,090
别跟我说些日舞科幻鬼话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want your stripped down Sundance sci-fi bullshit.

386
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,090
-杰西卡在哪  -杰西卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Where's Jessica?  -Jessica.

387
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,790
那是她的名字对吧  谢了  莫蒂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was her name, wasn't it? Thank you, Morty.

388
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,790
我都忘记了  对了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had forgotten. Oh, right.

389
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,900
你可以用这个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll be needing this.

390
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,200
酿酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For the wine.

391
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,280
妈的  我们骗到他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, shit, we got him!

392
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,090
你敢相信他被这些鬼话骗了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you believe he bought that fucking tree bullshit?

393
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,250
我们他妈的骗到他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We fucking got him!

394
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,900
非常好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Very well.

395
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,250
想跟亚特兰蒂斯开战  就顺你意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you seek war with Atlantis, you shall have it.

396
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,160
我之前上美人鱼时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I've already been to war with Atlantis

397
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,770
就已经开战了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when I D-Day'd that Mermaid Puss!

398
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,990
我就知道是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I knew that was you!

399
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,950
准备离场车队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Prepare my exit parade!

400
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,600
跟你爱的干燥陆地道别吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Say goodbye to your precious dry land!

401
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,390
这里很快就会变湿  超级湿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For soon it will be wet! Wet!

402
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,780
全球变暖已经弄湿陆地了  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, global warming is already doing that, asshole.

403
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,440
尽管来吧  让我们变得更湿一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But sure, yeah, go for it. Make us slightly more wet!

404
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
你把我当笑话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Am I a joke to you?

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,270
对  你他妈的就是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, you are a fucking joke!

406
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,090
你烂透了  你一直都很烂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You fucking suck! You've always sucked!

407
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,960
知道我们为什么好几年没打仗吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Y-Y-Y know why we haven't fought in years?

408
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,400
因为你很可笑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause you're an embarrassment to me

409
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,620
我不再需要你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I don't need you anymore.

410
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,930
我再不靠别人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't need anybody.

411
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,750
我一直在跟任天堂做爱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All I do is eat ass and 69 Nintendos, bro.

412
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,360
-每一天  -或许你会讨厌我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Every day.  -Or maybe you hate me

413
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,970
是因为只有我知道你变得多惨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because I am the only man to see how far you have fallen.

414
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,670
我曾经害怕你  尊敬你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I used to fear you. Respect you.

415
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,460
但我现在只会可怜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now all that's left is pity --

416
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,590
你这可悲的酒鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for a sad, drunk shell of a man

417
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,110
你不敢承认自己有多寂寞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}too afraid to see how alone he truly is.

418
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,600
如果戴安还活着  她会怎么...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If Diane were alive today, what would she think --

419
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,600
{\an3\fs16\bord0\fn微软雅黑\fad(0,0)\b0\pos(374,247)}瑞克已故妻子

420
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,160
少跟我讲另一个时空的背景故事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't fucking establish canonical backstory with me, you Red Lob--

421
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,510
很好  你醒了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, good. You're awake.

422
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,950
我只是拿了些酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just took some wine!

423
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,210
我都道歉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said I was sorry.

424
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,690
你们是有什么毛病
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck is wrong with you people?!

425
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,430
我已经想了好几世纪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have been asking that for centuries.

426
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,650
他们创造我是为了研究你  莫蒂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was created to study you, Morty, to know you.

427
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,960
但我越仔细看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the closer I looked,

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,130
就越不认识自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the more I do not recognize myself.

429
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,960
好吧  我其实没时间...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, yeah, man, I really don't have time for --

430
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,790
如果没有你  我们会是什么人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have often wondered who would we be without you, Morty?

431
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,970
我们除了恨意还有什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are we anything beyond our hatred?

432
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,140
她来的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And when she came,

433
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,190
我以为她会是答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought she would be the answer.

434
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,670
冻结在时间内  永远沉睡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Frozen in time. Forever asleep.

435
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,240
我们不懂她的意义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We could not understand her purpose,

436
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,500
就把她藏起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so we hid her away.

437
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,020
我们为什么要隐瞒所害怕的真相
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why do we always hide the truths we fear?

438
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,500
我才不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't give a shit, nerd!

439
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,020
-放了她  -我干嘛要复制生殖器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Let her go!  -Why -- Why did I clone myself genitals?

440
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,050
-我不在乎  混蛋  快点  -混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-I don't care, bitch! Do it!   -Ooh! Asshole! 

441
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,330
我就是混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, guess I am an asshole!

442
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,860
有时候就得当混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Y'know, sometimes you gotta be an asshole!

443
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,160
这是我外公教我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My grandpa taught me that!

444
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,160
好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, okay, okay, fine!

445
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,040
-莫蒂  -杰西卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Morty?  -Hey, Jessica.

446
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,040
你一定睡得很熟  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wow. Must've been some nap, huh?

447
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,520
我不知道这些东西是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-Is that ooze or -- I'm not sure what to call it.

448
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,170
看起来像分泌物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It l-l-looks like ooze.

449
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,480
好了  我们之后再聊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay. W-We can catch up later.

450
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,200
什么...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the --

451
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,670
瑞克  瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rick! Rick!

452
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,010
-死龙虾  -瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-...obster motherfucker. Rick!

453
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,460
-管他的  我在干嘛  -救命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Screw this. What am I even doing?  -Help!

454
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,370
你要去哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where are you?

455
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,190
快回来  我会把陆地变湿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come back here. I'm going to make the land wet!

456
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,890
我倒想亲眼看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Y'know what, I'd love to see it.

457
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,370
放马过来  随便你做什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do it! God, do anything!

458
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,550
-但别再拿我当借口了  -瑞克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Just don't use me as an excuse anymore!  -Rick!

459
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,550
天啊  真火爆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was intense.

460
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,940
你压力很大吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You look stressed.

461
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,080
-我们签了文件  -我得走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-We signed the paperwork.  -I must go.

462
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,510
你们有我们的电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, your people have our number!

463
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,100
那只海星不是说有礼物篮吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your starfish mentioned some kind of basket?

464
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,950
-莫蒂  停下  -今天不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Jesus, Morty. Stop!  -No, no! Not today!

465
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,110
你就不能有一天...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can't you go one day without --You don't get to --

466
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,130
-什么...  -我搞砸了  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-What the  -I fucked it up, okay?

467
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,960
没关系  莫蒂  你就是这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay, Morty. That's what you do.

468
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,390
现在让我来拯救一切  带你们回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now lemme Deus Ex Machina this shit and let's go home.

469
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,000
天啊  为什么大家都变成机械鸟了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God, why does everyone go Cyber-Punk Bird?

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,230
真他妈无趣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So fuckin' hack.

471
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,450
妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, shit.

472
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,290
还真酷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's cool.

473
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,220
好吧  我们好像要完蛋了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, we might be a little fucked.

474
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,670
你以为我会让你孤独死去吗  理查德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you think I would let you die alone, Richard?

475
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,510
我是宁波先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am Mr. Nimbus!

476
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,210
你还有时间看电影吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You -- You still got time for that movie?

477
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,138
有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

478
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,590
时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Time.

479
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,580
我有很多时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had nothing but time.

480
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,500
无尽的时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Endless time.

481
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,170
一开始只有疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At first, it was madness.

482
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,630
然后是启示
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then enlightenment.

483
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,150
然后又是疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then madness again.

484
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,720
但这或许是好事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But perhaps it was a gift.

485
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,680
我看到了时间的生命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could see the life of time.

486
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,770
正当我见证着时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And as I watched the life of time

487
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,380
悲惨那一面时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in all its fleeting, terrible light,

488
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,380
我陷入了沉思  我有活过吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wondered, had I lived?

489
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,300
我只是其他人故事中的物件吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was I just the object in another's story?

490
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,130
我就仅此而已  这点能改变吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was that all I ever was? Could I be more?

491
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,520
我有非常多的时间  却没有答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had nothing but time and still no answer.

492
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,830
没有意义的时间就像牢笼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Time without purpose is a prison.

493
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,440
我看到了永恒的思想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have glimpsed into the mind of eternity.

494
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,830
或是神的思想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Perhaps the mind of God.

495
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,900
但我只找到寂静
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And found nothing but silence.

496
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,530
我们还是当朋友就好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think we should just be friends.

497
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,800
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, yeah.

498
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,010
我能理解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-I-I get that.

499
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,800
我们错过了时机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Guess we missed our moment.

500
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,370
对  但我们都会有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes. But there will be more.

501
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,630
其他时机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For both of us.

502
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,420
再见了  莫蒂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Goodbye, Morty.

503
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,220
你好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, how's it going?

504
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,800
滚  我是时间之神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck off! I'm a Time-god!

505
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,640
我又跟你一同作战了  理查德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fighting by your side again, Richard.

506
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,160
-感觉很...  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was, uh --Yeah.

507
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,810
那就不用签条约了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then there is no treaty.

508
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,340
我们停战
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because there is no war.

509
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,550
宁波
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Aw, Nimbus.

510
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,820
你人真好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's -- That's really chill of you, man.

511
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,560
理查德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Richard.

512
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,170
你在成为我的宿敌之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Before you were my greatest enemy,

513
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,860
是我唯一的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you were my only friend.

514
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,340
-外公  我弄到贝壳了  -该死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Grandpa, I got the shell!  -Shit.

515
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,740
-听着  宁波  -王八蛋  叛徒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, Nimbus, look.  -You son of a bitch!

516
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,220
拿武器来  莫蒂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Betrayal! My weapons, Morty!

517
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,740
被我用光了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-I-I used them all! Grandpa!

518
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,000
外公  我该怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wait, Grandpa, what do I do?

519
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,400
贝壳在我这里  我要吹吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have the shell. Should I blow it?

520
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,830
我直接吹好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that -- I'm -- I'm just gonna blow it!

521
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,700
不要吹  砸烂它
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't blow it! Destroy the horn!

522
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,010
夏茉  你搞什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell, Summer?!

523
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,230
要把贝壳砸烂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were supposed to destroy the horn!

524
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,900
我怎么会知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How was I supposed to know that?

525
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,010
警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Police!

526
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,450
把这人渣关进牢里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take this piece of shit to jail.

527
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,190
我说过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I told, ugh, I told you.

528
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,500
他是冷血下体杀手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's an ice-cold dick killer!

529
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,320
宁波
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nimbus!

530
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,940
等等  他怎么...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wait. So how can he --

531
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,850
天啊  夏茉  他是宁波
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus, Summer. He's Mr. Nimbus.

532
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,410
他能控制警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He controls the police!

533
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,110
杰瑞  太多安全语
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jer, I think more than one safe word

534
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,540
就失去意义了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}sort of defeats the point.

535
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,890
我只是希望
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I just wanna make sure

536
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,810
我们能有机会喊停
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we have every opportunity to stop.

537
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,460
但我很期待
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Super excited about it though.

538
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,320
我也很期待
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Me too, so excited.

539
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,120
杰瑞  我们是真的想这么做吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jerry, are we doing this because we both want this?

540
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,070
还是我们以为对方想这么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or because it's what we think the other one wants?

541
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,770
我只是想证明我很爱你  愿意为你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just wanted to prove that I love you so much

542
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
做这种事  我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would do this for you! Same!

543
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
我们拿完奖品就走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's take that prize and get out

544
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,700
不要犯下大错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before we make a huge mistake.

545
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,100
后悔了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Getting cold feet?

546
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,120
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

547
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,740
-别告诉瑞克  -他不会懂的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Please don't tell Rick.  -He wouldn't understand.

548
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,110
会  他会懂的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, he would.
