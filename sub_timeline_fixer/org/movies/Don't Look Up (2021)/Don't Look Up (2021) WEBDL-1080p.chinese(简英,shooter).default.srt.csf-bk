‎-干杯！ ‎-好
Cheers!

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,916
‎从你发现它的位置来看
It's gotta be, look… It's gotta be an Oort cloud comet

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,833
‎一定是来自奥尔特云的彗星
just based on where you saw it.

27
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,083
‎它上次距离太阳这么近
Probably the last time it was this close to the Sun

28
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
‎可能远在人类文明之前
was long before human civilization.

29
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,541
‎看它的弧线 天啊 太神奇了
Look at the arc on that thing. God, it's amazing.

30
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,083
‎明迪教授 我们该如何计算 ‎这颗彗星的速度和轨道呢？
How would we find out the comet's velocity in orbit, Professor Mindy?

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,625
‎问得好
That is a good question.

32
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,166
‎肯定会很有趣的 我研究生毕业后 ‎就没算过轨道动力学的题了
This will be fun. I haven't done orbital dynamics since grad school.

33
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,000
‎问题是…
Question is, what…

34
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,416
‎卡尔萨根会怎么做？
What would Carl Sagan do?

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,875
‎他会回归第一原理

36
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,875

21 Twenty-one.

39
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,875
24 Twenty-four.

40
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,250
‎是不是很有趣 各位？
Thirteen. ‎13 This is fun, huh, guys?

41
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,458
‎-哇 你让我兴奋起来了
‎-67 Sixty-seven. Wow. Now you got me pumped.

42
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,791
‎-明迪博士 ‎-好的
Dr. Mindy. All right…

43
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,583
‎你要计算多少个才能…
How many terms do you have to calibrate…

44
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,458
‎根据马斯登85 这是个很好的近似值
Approximation of coordinates in Marsden, '85.

45
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,958
‎现在有了彗星的轨道 ‎我们来看看星历表
Now that we have the comet's orbit, we will check the ephemeris

46
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,875
‎这样可以算出彗星和地球之间的距离
and that will give us the distance between the comet and planet Earth.

47
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,083
‎星历表的数值为什么越来越小？
Why does the ephemeris keep getting lower and lower?

48
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,833
‎明迪教授？
Professor Mindy?

49
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,625
‎明迪教授？
Professor Mindy?

50
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,041
‎各位 要不我们…
You know what, guys? Let's…

51
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,458
‎我们今晚就到这吧？
Let's call it a night, huh?

52
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,833
‎可是相对位置呢？
But what about the relative position?

53
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,500
‎我没算清楚 今晚不行 各位 抱歉
I can't figure this one out. Not tonight, guys. Sorry.

54
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,666
‎-走吧 我累了 ‎-我也是
Let's hit it, man. I'm beat. Me too.

where I had to tell my team we lost eight billion in funding.

64
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,208
‎我很抱歉 考尔德博士
I am so sorry, Dr. Calder,

65
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,125
‎但我们刚发现的这颗彗星

00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,833
‎明迪教授想说的是
What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is

288
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,416
‎有一颗彗星正朝地球飞来
there's a comet headed towards Earth,

289
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,750
‎根据美国国家航空航天局电脑的计算
and according to NASA's computers,

290
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,958
‎这个天体将落在智利海岸正西方
that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean

291
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,166
‎100公里处的太平洋中
at 62 miles due west off the coast of Chile.

292
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
‎然后呢？会引发潮汐波？
Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?

293
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,666
‎不 结果远比潮汐波有毁灭性
No. It will be far more catastrophic.

294
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,375
‎到时将会有数千米高的海啸席卷全球
There'll be mile-high tsunamis fanning out all across the globe.

295
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:32,458
‎如果这颗彗星发生撞击 ‎威力将相当于十亿颗广岛原子弹
If this comet makes impact, it will have the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.

296
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,375
‎将会发生10级或11级地震…
There'll be magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes--

297
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,375
‎等等 你的呼吸节奏很奇怪 ‎让我感觉不舒服
You're breathing weird. It's, uh, making me uncomfortable.

298
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,000
‎抱歉 我只是在努力解释科学研究
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to articulate the science.

299
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,208
‎我知道 但听起来太压抑了 ‎我努力在听…
I know. But it's so stressful. I'm trying to, like, listen--

300
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,833
‎我觉得你没有理解情况的严重性
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.

301
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,875
‎我在尽力阐述…
I'm trying to articulate it the best I can--

302
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,791
‎总统女士 这颗彗星 ‎就是我们所谓的地球杀手
Madam President, this comet is what we call a planet-killer.

303
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,333
‎没错
That is correct.

304
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,333
‎这个结论有多肯定？
So how certain is this?

305
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,541
‎撞击概率是100%
There's 100% certainty of impact.

306
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,666
‎拜托 别说100%
Please, don't say 100%.

307
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,416
‎我们可以称之为潜在重要事件吗？
Can we just call it a potentially significant event?

308
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,375
‎-对 ‎-好
Yeah. Yes.

309
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,666
‎但这不是潜在会发生的事
But it isn't potentially going to happen.

310
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,916
‎它一定会发生的
It is going to happen.

311
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,083
‎没错 准确地说是99. 78%
Exactly. 99. 78% to be exact.

312
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,291
‎很好 那就不是100%
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

313
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,250
‎科学家从来都不喜欢说100%
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

314
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,791
‎就当是70%吧 继续往下说
Call it 70% and let's just move on.

315
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,541
‎但概率根本没有70%那么低
But it's not even close to 70%.

316
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,958
‎你总不能到处和别人说
You cannot go around saying to people

317
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,750
‎他们100%会死吧
that there's 100% chance that they're gonna die.

318
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,791
‎那可太疯狂了
You know? It's just nuts.

319
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,000
‎我们应该找我们的科学家们看看 ‎无意冒犯
We should get some of our scientists on this, you know.

320
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,250
‎但你们这么两个人跟着…
No offense, but you're just two people that walked in here with--

321
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,541
‎奥格尔索普博士
Dr. Oglethorpe.

322
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
‎奥夫…奥吉尔维博士 对
Dr. Ov… Ogilvy. Yeah.

323
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,791
‎我在美国国家航空航天局 ‎负责行星防御事务已经15年了
I've been head of planetary defense at NASA for 15 years.

324
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,333
‎而明迪博士是 ‎密歇根州立大学天文学终身教授
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor of astronomy at Michigan State,

325
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,458
‎迪比亚斯基小姐是那里的博士候选人
where Miss Dibiasky is a doctoral candidate.

326
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,416
‎-很好 ‎-不好意思
Good. I'm sorry.

327
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,083
‎你刚才说“密歇根州立”？
Did you say Michigan State?

328
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,750
‎没错 他们的天文学系非常出色
Exactly. They have an excellent astronomy department.

329
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,250
‎-是的 ‎-得了吧
Yes. Come on, bro.

330
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
‎开什么玩笑？ ‎要看我的大学入学考试成绩吗？
You kidding? You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

331
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,708
‎好了 我们来说重点吧
Okay, let's bottom line this.

332
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,625
‎这件事需要我付出什么？
What is this gonna cost me?

333
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,875
‎你们的要求是什么？
You know, what's the ask here?

334
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:17,041
‎政府有现成的计划
There are government plans in place.

335
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,541
‎我们可以通过 ‎美国国家航空航天局采取行动
Um, actions we can take through NASA.

336
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,583
‎可以用装备核武器的无人机
Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

337
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:27,083
‎尝试改变彗星的运行方向
to deflect and hopefully change the orbit of this comet.

338
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,916
‎我们必须马上行动
We must act now.

339
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,583
‎嘿 好的
Oh, hey. All right, all right, all right.

340
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,750
‎中期选举还有多久？
-When are the midterms?

341
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,000
‎-三周 ‎-三周
Three weeks. Three weeks.

342
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,833
‎如果消息在那之前流出 ‎国会那边我们就输定了
So, if this breaks before then, we lose Congress.

343
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,833
‎然后我们就一点办法也没有了
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

344
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:39,833
‎政治僵局
It'll be gridlocked.

345
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,916
‎时机…糟透了
-The timing is just… It's atrocious.

346
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,125
‎好吧 目前我觉得我们静观其变
Okay, at this very moment, I say we sit tight and assess.

347
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,833
‎-静观其变 ‎-找其他人一起来评估一下
Sit tight and assess.

348
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,625
‎找些藤校毕业生
Let's get some other people on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

349
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,041
‎你和我一起审阅一下 ‎航空航天局的计划 好吗？
And you and I will review the NASA plans.

350
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,291
‎非常感谢
-Okay? I'd greatly appreciate that.

351
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,583
‎如果我没理解错的话
Am I to understand correctly that,

352
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,416
‎在今天接收了所有这些信息之后
after all of the information you've received today,

353
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:12,291
‎你做出的决定是“静观其变”？
the decision you're making is to "sit tight and assess"?

354
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,625
‎-不好意思 她谁啊？ ‎-你他妈谁啊？你不是她儿子吗？
-I'm sorry, who is she? Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

355
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,375
‎我他妈是白宫幕僚长 是龙纹身男孩
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff, Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

356
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,875
‎不用你操心
So I'm doing fine.

357
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,541
‎我们走吧 真是一场闹剧
We gotta get out of here. This place is a freak show.

358
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,208
‎我觉得迪比亚斯基小姐想说的是
I think what Miss Dibiasky is trying to say

359
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:30,375
‎静观其变的想法是非常非常危险的…
is that the idea of sitting tight is an extremely, extremely dangerous--

360
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,583
‎谢谢 今天总算有件好事了
Thank you. One good thing happened today.

361
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,041
‎好吧 说个趣事
Okay, funny story.

362
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,541
‎我竞选总统的时候
When I was running for president,

363
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,958
‎竞选活动的第一个月 ‎我不得不偷偷抽烟
I had to sneak cigarettes for the whole first month of the campaign

364
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,291
‎因为我抽烟的照片
because, you know, photographs of me smoking

365
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,333
‎价值多少来着 十万美元一张？
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?

366
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,500
‎所以我一直藏着 但后来受够了
So, I'm always hiding, but, you know, I just got sick of it.

367
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,583
‎我就说：“随便吧 ‎我想抽的时候就要抽”
And I just said, "You know what, I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to. "

368
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,791
‎你猜怎么着？
Guess what happened?

369
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:06,500
‎-我的民调支持率上涨了三个点 ‎-他们喜欢她的真实
-I went up three points in the polls. They loved that she kept it real.

370
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,458
‎人们喜欢看有魅力的人抽烟
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

371
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,583
‎我想不到还有哪位总统 ‎让我希望能在《花花公子》上看到
I can't think of another president that I'd ever wanna see in Playboy.

‎这种“世界末日要来了”的会议 ‎这些年来我们开了多少次
Do you know how many, uh, "the world is ending" meetings

373
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,708
‎你们知道吗？

‎经济崩溃、核泄漏 ‎汽车尾气破坏大气层
Economic collapse, loose nukes, car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

‎您能明白这是末日级别的事件吧
You do understand that this is an apocalyptic event.

This is a large celestial body heading towards our planet at speeds--

383

‎我明白 明迪博士
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

384
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,625
‎我听到你说的话了
I hear you.

‎您不知道听到您这么说我有多欣慰
I'm so glad to hear that. You have no idea.

388
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:03,000
‎嘿 各位 我们今天聊的事 ‎显然都是超级机密 对吧？
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked about in here, super classified, right?

389

Thanks for dressing up.

391
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,041
‎我们要就这样把消息泄露给媒体？
You're saying we're just gonna leak it to the press?

392
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,583
‎-这不违法吗？ ‎-是的 我们要泄露出去
-Isn't that illegal? Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

393
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,375
‎你可能没意识到 ‎白宫刚刚把我们打发走了
In case you didn't notice, the White House just blew us off.

398
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:38,416
‎-我感觉这不是我应该有的行为 ‎-你只要讲故事就好

‎那是法语吗？
Was that French?

1146
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:37,000
‎是的 意思是“天使们飞往天堂”
Yes, it is. It means, "the angels soar to the heavens. " It's, um…

‎看着这场面 让我想到了它
And just watching this, it just made me think of it,

1149

1158
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,291
‎看起来好像调头了
Looks like it's turning around.

1159
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:40,250
‎不 没有 这是轨道纠偏
No, it's not. It's a course correction.

1160
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,875
‎是标准流程
It's pretty standard.

1161

1164
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,875
‎但我和大家说实话
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

1165
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,916
‎此刻记者也无语了
This reporter is at a loss for words right now.

1166
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,208

‎还是锁着的
It's still locked.

1171
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,416

I just don't… I don't understand what could've happened.

1172
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,250
‎任务当时进行顺利 ‎是不是？一切正常
I mean, the mission was working, right? Everything was on track.

1173
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,541
‎是啊 一切皆有可能
Yeah. I mean, it could've been anything, uh…

1174
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,958
‎也许导航系统故障了 核弹不稳定 ‎很多可能性
Guidance system could've malfunctioned, uh, nuke destabilized, myriad of things.

1175

‎走进战情室的那个男人是谁？
Who was that guy that walked into the Situation Room?

1176
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:35,625
‎看起来很眼熟
He looked familiar.

1177

He's the guy that, uh, bought the Gutenberg Bible and lost it.

1179
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:48,916
‎抱歉让你们久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1180

1200
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:35,625
‎女士们先生们 我们以为

1201
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:40,708
‎全世界以为的这场紧迫、可怕的危机
what the world thought was an impending and terrifying danger,

1202
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:44,625
‎结果竟是一个令人激动的机会
turns out to be an astonishing opportunity.

1203
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,166
‎我们的盟友们非常困惑 正寻求解释…
Our allies are very confused and demanding answers--

1204
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,541
‎让他们等着
Well, tell 'em to wait.

1205
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:54,833
‎根据迪比亚斯基彗星 ‎最新的光谱仪检测数据
According to the most recent spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,

1206
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:57,833
‎由巴什蜂窝的天文学家算出
made by the astrogeologists at BASH Cellular,

1207
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,291
‎我们有了新的发现
we've discovered something.

1208
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,000
‎一些奇迹般的发现
Something truly miraculous.

1209
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:08,125
‎彼得？
Peter. Peter?

1210
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,000
‎谢谢你 贾妮
-Oh, thank you, Janie.

1211
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,708
‎如你们中有些人所知
As, uh… As some of you may know,

1212
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:17,541
‎世界上最珍贵的矿产
the most valuable minerals in the world

1213
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,750
‎快速变成了
are fast becoming those that are deployed

1214
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:24,000
‎用来制造手机和电脑的物质
in the manufacture of cell phones and, uh, computers.

1215
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:27,583
‎钇、铽、锇、镝等等
Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium, on and on and on.

1216
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,000
‎资源短缺
We're running short.

1217
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,916
‎这个问题变得更加严重是因为
Uh, and the problem is exacerbated, of course,

1218
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,916
‎中国掌握着几乎所有
because China has her big panda paw firmly on almost all the mines

1219
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,500
‎出产这些宝贵稀缺地球资源的矿
that produce these valuable rare Earth assets.

1220
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,000
‎你们可以想象
So you can imagine.

1221
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:44,666
‎哇！
Wow!

1222
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,541
‎我们巴什公司高兴极了
Just how happy we were at BASH

1223
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,250
‎因为我们的天文学家发现
when our astrogeologists discovered

1224
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:57,000
‎这颗从宇宙深处 ‎朝地球急速飞来的彗星
and then determined that this comet, hurtling towards us from deep space,

1225
01:09:57,083 --> 01:10:02,833
‎蕴藏着价值至少 ‎32万亿美元的重要矿产
actually contains at least $32 trillion of these critical materials.

1226
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:04,666
‎这对技术来说非常重要
Critical to technology.

1227
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:05,958
‎-如果我们要继续… ‎-抱歉
If we're to proceed--

1228
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,541
‎中止整个任务的原因
I'm sorry. Is that why you aborted this entire mission,

1229
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,541
‎就是你们想开采彗星上的稀缺矿产？
is because you're trying to mine the comet for rare minerals?

1230
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:16,458
‎明迪博士 我觉得我们应该等 ‎整个演讲结束后再提问
I think we should hold all questions

1231
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,458
until the end of the presentation,

1232
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,125
‎到时也许你的问题就已经得到了回答
and you might find that your questions are answered.

1233
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,750
‎是的 总统女士
Yes, Madam President.

1234
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:27,333
‎考虑其他金属的话 彗星实际蕴藏了
When you… When the other metals are factored in, the comet actually contains

1235
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:31,541
‎价值近140万亿美元的资源
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.

1236
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:32,875
‎140万亿
Buck-forty trilli.

1237
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:34,416
‎嗯…
Yeah…

1238
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:40,000
‎如果我们都要死了 ‎这些万亿美元又有什么意义？
What do these trillions of dollars even matter if we're all gonna die--

1239
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,458
‎我也想问这个问题 贾妮
I was about to ask the same question, Janie.

1240
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,666
‎为何不征求我们的意见？
Why weren't we consulted?

1241
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,500
‎-恕我直言 总统女士… ‎-哦 不！
All due respect, Madam President…

1242
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,833
‎-…这极其危险 ‎-如果我们既赚了钱又安然无恙呢？
Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?

1243
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,125
‎我在脑子里一遍遍回想
I've gone over it again and again and again in my head

1244
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,791
‎我还是想不通
and I still can't make sense of it.

1245
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:03,791
‎他是个三星中将 在五角大楼工作
He's a three-star general. He works at the Pentagon.

1246
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:09,000
‎为什么要拿免费零食收我们的钱？
Why would he charge us for free snacks?

1247
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:12,750
‎我有一次遇到了斯汀
One time, I met Sting,

1248
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:18,291
‎我对天发誓 他就在我面前放了屁
and I swear to God, he farted right in front of me.

1249
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:24,458
‎没有避开视线 也没有说“抱歉”
Didn't break eye contact and didn't even say "excuse me. "

1250
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,125
‎关键是 他丝毫没有引起反感
And the thing is, he actually pulled it off.

1251
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,875
‎因为我依然觉得他很有魅力
'Cause I still found him to be quite charming.

1252
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:40,333
‎两位 我们得谈谈 我们走 马上
Guys, we have to talk. Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

1253
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,625
‎太疯狂了 彻头彻尾的疯狂
It's insane. Like, completely insane.

1254
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,041
‎根本不可能成功的
It will never work.

1255
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,291
‎我和你的反应一模一样
I had the exact same reaction.

1256
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,375
‎这可是一颗直径九公里的地球杀手
This is a nine-kilometer-wide planet-killer we're talking about,

1257
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,041
‎不是在说漫游费
not roaming charges.

1258
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:59,041
‎他们取消任务 我也很困惑、很愤怒
Look, I… I was confused and outraged that they turned this mission around too,

1259
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:01,708
‎但他们的团队有斯坦福的盖里泰可蒙
but they've got Gary Talcamont from Stanford

1260
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,958
‎和普林斯顿的丽莎伊内兹
and Lisa Inez from Princeton on their team.

1261
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:07,750
‎这可是下一代最前沿的技术
I mean, this is next-generation cutting-edge technology.

1262
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:14,625
‎一颗巨大的彗星显然对地球来说 ‎是存亡攸关的重大威胁
Obviously, one giant comet is a major and existential, uh, threat to our planet,

1263
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:20,000
‎但我们可以应付30个小型流星体
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

1264
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:26,625
‎我们的必得机 ‎也就是巴什探索开采无人机
Our BEADS, that stands for BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,

1265
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,083
‎如你们所见
that you see here,

1266
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:30,833
‎将会把机体附着在彗星上
attach themselves to the comet

1267
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,375
‎使用纳米技术进行扫描
and scan it with nanotechnology

1268
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:36,583
‎该技术由诺贝尔奖得主
developed by Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

1269
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:37,666
‎盖里泰可蒙开发
Dr. Gary Talcamont.

1270
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,500

-What's it called again? It's called Total Devastation.

1559
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:56,208
‎耗资三亿美元
-It cost $300 million to make. Whoo!

1560
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:59,333
‎-这些电影啊… ‎-比你赚的还多
-I mean, these movies It's more than you earn.

1561
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:01,791
‎可不是 我朋友法利看过了
Tell me about it. And my friend Farley, he saw it.

1562
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,625
‎-他说特别有趣 是的 ‎-法利喜欢
-He said it's a ton of fun. That's right. Well, Farley likes it.

1563
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:07,250
‎好吧 法利说的都对
All right, well, what Farley says goes.

1564
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,583
‎不过首先
But, uh, first,

1565
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:12,458
‎是的 从我的笑容可以猜到…
and yes, you can tell from my smile…

1566
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:13,833
‎别闹了
Stop it.

1567
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:18,916
‎美国最性感的科学家来了 ‎兰德尔博士 欢迎
That America's sexiest scientist is here. Dr. Randall. Welcome.

1568
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:21,375
‎兰德尔博士 你好吗？
Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?

1569
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:24,208
‎我很好 好得不能再好了
I'm--  I'm good. I'm gooder than good.

1570
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:30,958
‎好了 兰德尔 ‎我们听说彗星并不存在
All right. So, Randall, we're hearing that there is no comet,

1571
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,375
‎或者彗星存在 但这是好事 ‎又或者是坏事
or that there is a comet but it's a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

1572
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,750
‎我们很困惑
We are so confused.

1573
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:41,166
‎能帮帮我们吗 睿智的科学家？
So, could you please help us out here, you know, oh, wise scientist?

1574
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:47,666
‎首先 布里 彗星当然存在
Well, first and foremost, Brie, um… …there most certainly is a comet.

1575
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,791
‎好的
All right.

1576
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:52,125
‎我们知道有这么一颗彗星 ‎因为我们有数据
And we know that there is a comet because we have the data.

1577
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:58,666
‎最近 科学界越来越忧心忡忡
Um… There has been growing concern within the scientific community as of late.

1578
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:02,875
‎同行评审流程是非常有必要的…
You see, the peer-review process is absolutely essential…

1579
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:05,708
‎-如果巴什的股票… ‎-…这样我们才能获取事实…什么？
-If BASH's stock… …for us to get to the facts of… Yes?

1580
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,458
‎如果巴什的股票算一个指标的话
If BASH's stock is any indicator,

1581
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:09,083
‎那我们就不用操心同行评审了
we don't have to worry about the peer review.

1582
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:10,583
‎股票涨势爆棚
It is going gangbusters.

1583
01:30:10,666 --> 01:30:13,125
‎听我说 我全盘托出 ‎我尽可能买了很多股份
And full disclosure. I bought as many shares as I could.

1584
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,500
‎我建议你们都这么做
I advise you to do the same.

1585
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:16,333
‎你真是个无耻的资本家
You are such a shameless capitalist.

1586
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:19,458
‎这个会躺在我家后露台的全新浴缸里 ‎泡在我从股市
Said the woman who will be in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck

1587
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:22,083
‎-取出的钞票里的女人如是说 ‎-你太了解我了
-when I put it in from the stock. You know me too well.

1588
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,375
‎没错
That's right.

1589
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:25,875
‎兰德尔博士 你还好吗？ ‎要不要喝口水…
Dr. Randall, you sure you're okay? You want a glass of water…

1590
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,166
‎我不太舒服
I don't feel so good.

1591
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,625
‎好吧 我想我们先进一段广告…
So I think we'll go to commercial break--

1592
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:33,291
‎不 拜托 布里 ‎别断开直播 让我说几句话
No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away. Let me say something.

1593
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,916
‎-好的 ‎-那你来对地方了
-Okay. You came to the right place.

1594
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,333
‎因为这节目里 我们就喜欢说话
We like to say things.

1595
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:40,416
‎你能不能别一直这么…愉快？
Would you please just stop being so pleasant?

1596
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,791
‎不好意思 ‎但不是所有事情都需要抖机灵
I'm sorry, but not everything needs to sound so goddamn clever

1597
01:30:44,875 --> 01:30:47,083
‎变幻出迷人讨喜的感觉
or charming or likeable all the time.

1598
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:50,583
‎有时候我们需要能和彼此讲道理
Sometimes we need to just be able to say things to one another.

1599
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,083
‎要把别人的话听进去
We need to hear things.

1600
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:57,125
‎我们再重申一次
Look, let's establish, once again,

1601
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,916
‎确实有一颗巨型彗星正朝地球飞来
that there is a huge comet headed towards Earth.

1602
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,291
‎我们之所以知道有这样一颗彗星
And the reason we know that there is a comet

1603
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:06,833
‎是因为我们看到了
is because we saw it.

1604
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:10,208
‎我们用望远镜亲眼看到了
We saw it with our own eyes using a telescope.

1605
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,500
‎老天啊 我们他妈的还拍了照！
I mean, for God's sake, we took a fucking picture of it!

1606
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:15,291
‎我们还需要什么证据？
What other proof do we need?

1607
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:18,375
‎如果我们连这都不能达成一致
And if we can't all agree at the bare minimum

1608
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:22,875
‎同意一颗和珠穆朗玛峰一样大的彗星
that a giant comet the size of Mount Everest

1609
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:29,041
‎朝地球呼啸而来他妈的不是件好事
hurtling its way towards planet Earth is not a fucking good thing,

1610
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,125
‎那我们会有什么下场？
then what the hell happened to us?

1611
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,333
‎我的天呐 我们要如何和彼此对话？
I mean, my God, how do How do we even talk to each other?

1612
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:41,208
‎我们对自己做了什么？ ‎我们要如何弥补？
What've we… What've we done to ourselves? How do we fix it?

1613
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,791
‎我们应该在 ‎还有机会的时候撞偏这颗彗星
We should have deflected this comet when we had the fucking chance,

1614
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:48,083
‎但我们没有实施 我不知道为什么
but we didn't do it. I don't know why we didn't do it.

1615
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:52,041
‎现在他们竟然还开除 ‎像我一样的科学家
And now they're actually firing scientists like me

1616
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:54,666
‎就因为我们发声反对他们
for speaking out, for opposing them.

1617
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:57,875
‎我知道很多人
And I'm sure many of the people out there

1618
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,958
‎根本不会听我说的
aren't even gonna listen to what I just said

1619
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:02,833
‎因为他们有自己的政治意识形态
'cause they have their own political ideology,

1620
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,916
‎但我…我向你们保证
but I… assure you,

1621
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,583
‎我不站在任何人的一边
I am not on one side or the other.

1622
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:10,916
‎我只是他妈的把事实告诉你们
I'm just telling you the fucking truth.

1623
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,625
‎我觉得这时候最好说明一下
This would be a good time to establish

1624
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:15,250
‎伊舍威尔和总统都说过
that Isherwell and the president have both said

1625
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,958
‎会有好处…
that there's benefits to be--

1626
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:21,750
‎对 美国总统他妈的在说谎！
Right, well, the president of the United States is fucking lying!

1627
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:24,708
‎我和你们一样
Look, I'm just like all of you.

1628
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:29,833
‎天地良心 我希望 ‎这位总统知道自己在做什么
I hope to God, I hope to God that this president knows what she's doing.

1629
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,750
‎我希望她能为我们考虑 但事实是
I hope she's got us all taken care of, but the truth is,

1630
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:36,875
‎我觉得整届政府
I think this whole administration

1631
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:41,500
‎都他妈完全疯了！
has completely lost their fucking mind!

1632
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:45,125
‎我觉得我们都会死！
And I think we're all gonna die!

1633
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:51,000
‎我只想回家
Look, I just wanna go home.

1634
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,125
‎我现在除了回家什么都不想做
I just wanna go home. I just wanna go home more than anything.

1635
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,583
‎但只有一件事
But if there is one thing,

1636
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:09,666
‎有一件事我希望你们能听进去
one thing that I pray…that I pray that all of you hear from what I have just said,

1637
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:13,583
‎那就是我们所有人 我们都…
is that all of us, all of us…

1638
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:23,625
‎你为什么要这么做？
Why'd you do that?

1639
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:28,250
‎我本来真的挺喜欢你的 ‎大部分人都让我厌恶
I really liked you and I despise most people.

1640
01:33:29,791 --> 01:33:33,000
‎我真的以为我爱你
You know, I… I really thought I loved you.

1641
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:36,958
‎真的吗？
Really?

1642
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:38,750
‎哇
Wow.

1643
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:41,833
‎太疯狂了
That's wild.

1644
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,833
‎是啊
-Yeah.

1645
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:47,250
‎女士 你得离开了 ‎我们要让这个人与外界隔离
Ma'am, you need to go. We gotta get this man off the grid.

1646
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,500
‎你还在吗？
You still there?

1647
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:54,791
‎不在
No.

1648
01:33:57,291 --> 01:34:01,041
‎也许他就是在玩弄权力
Well, maybe he just gets off on the power, you know,

1649
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:02,791
‎跟任何一种权力一样
like any kind of power.

1650
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:07,791
‎他知道我最终会发现零食是免费的
It's like he knew eventually that I was gonna find out that the snacks were free.

1651
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,708
‎对
-Right. You know what I mean?

1652
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:09,958
‎-你明白吗？ ‎-嗯
-Yeah.

1653
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,833
‎这就是玩弄权力
So it was just like a power play.

1654
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:13,625
‎男人都很奇怪
Yeah, guys are weird.

1655
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,000
‎我开始觉得 ‎这些“世界末日”的言论都是胡扯
I'm starting to think that all this "end of the world" stuff is bullshit.

1656
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:22,833
‎不是的
It's not.

1657
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:26,833
‎真的会发生 我看到了
It's definitely happening. I've seen it.

1658
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,958
‎我不知道 ‎我觉得如果上帝想摧毁地球
I feel like if God wanted to destroy the Earth,

1659
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:31,041
‎祂就会摧毁地球
He would destroy the Earth.

1660
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,583
‎你相信上帝？
You believe in God?

1661
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:39,166
‎是的 我父母按福音派教义把我养大
Yeah, I mean, my parents raised me Evangelical,

1662
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,583
‎我恨他们 ‎但我以自己的方式接受了它
and I hate them, but I found my own way to it.

1663
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:42,916
‎我自己的连接
My own relationship.

1664
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,500
‎希望你不会说出去 我会感激你的
I'd appreciate it if you didn't advertise it, though.

1665
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,166
‎我不会跟别人说的 我觉得这样挺好
I won't tell anybody. I think it's kind of sweet.

1666
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,333
‎-要做爱吗？ ‎-好 干吗不做呢？
-Wanna make out? Yeah, why not?

1667
01:35:02,458 --> 01:35:05,458
‎能不能别说“干吗不做呢”？ ‎让我感觉你并不想做
Can you not say "why not"? It makes me feel like you don't want it.

1668
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:07,375
‎很不舒服
It's shitty.

1669
