1
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,360
（改編自艾薩克阿西莫夫的小說）

2
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,970
曾經有一個男人 拜訪哈里謝頓 請他告知自己的命運
Once, a man came to Hari Seldon and asked to be told his fate.

3
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
他想知道
He wanted to know

4
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,480
預測模型是否能測量他人生的重要性
whether the predictive models could chart the significance of his life.

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,280
但哈里告訴他 只有一群人的行為能被預測
But Hari told him only the movements of masses could be predicted.

6
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,210
個人的命運將永遠是一個謎
The fate of one individual will always remain a mystery.

7
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,460
文明的構造
The clockwork of civilization…

8
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,800
文化的興起與消亡
the rise and fall of cultures…

9
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,470
因果與世界
causes and worlds…

10
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,190
對于這些問題 哈里謝頓早已解開謎底
These were answers Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

11
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,940
信仰是一種強大的武器
Belief is a powerful weapon.

12
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,030
正因如此 帝國才這么忌憚哈里的預測
That's why the Empire feared Hari Seldon's predictions so much.

13
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,710
大帝們統治著世俗事物 但身后事呢 我們的靈魂呢 
Empires govern worldly concerns, but what comes after? Our souls?

14
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,670
這些屬于信仰范疇
These realms are the purview of faith.

15
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,920
而信仰是在永恒之火中鑄造的寶劍
And faith is a sword forged in the fires of the infinite.

16
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,970
大帝 你需要換種娛樂嗎 
Empire? Do you seek different amusement?

17
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,560
你就足夠了 常規的方式、常規的歡愉
You'll do. For the routine pleasures in the routine manner.

18
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,230
你喜歡哪種歡愉 大帝 
Which pleasures do you prefer, Empire?

19
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,400
你能提供虛無的歡愉嗎 那有可能嗎 
Do you offer the pleasure of nothing? Is that on the menu?

20
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,160
他們說的是真的嗎 誰都不能碰你 
Is it true? No one's allowed to touch you?

21
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,450
你的膽子挺大的啊
Bold, aren't you?

22
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,290
我只有24個小時來服侍你 我想好好利用
I have only 24 hours of service to you. I want to make the most of it.

23
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,420
那你試一下觸摸我吧
Then try to touch me.

24
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,920
我讓你試一下
I said try.

25
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,700
光環能阻擋動能
The aura repels kinetic energy.

26
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,090
再試一次 這一次動作輕柔一點
I want you to try it again, with a softer touch.

27
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
慢一點
Slower.

28
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,430
慢一點
Slower.

29
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,450
那么…
So, how…

30
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,570
其他部分呢 
…does the rest work?

31
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,460
怎么了 
What?

32
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,170
有事需要你務必出席 大帝
You are required, Empire.

33
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,100
我明白大帝此刻有肢體親密接觸的需求
I understand Empire has a physiological need for intimacy.

34
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,810
但當前事宜的重要性超出這一需求
But the current matter supersedes this need.

35
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,280
使者贊沃
Ambassador Thanwall.

36
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,200
至高無上的大帝 榮耀之光…
Most esteemed Empire, glory to the light--

37
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,830
有話直說吧 使者
Out with it, Ambassador.

38
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,250
比鄰星教宗歐珀去世了 大帝
Proxima Opal has passed, Empire.

39
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,460
節哀
Our condolences.

40
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,590
節哀 真誠致哀
Condolences. Heartfelt.

41
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,550
謝謝 大帝
Thank you, Empire.

42
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,130
比鄰星教宗歐珀的教眾將懷念及哀悼她
Proxima Opal will be missed and mourned by her flock.

43
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,430
主教團將提拔她的繼任者瑪澤菲爾格拉特
And now the conclave will elevate her successor, Zephyr Gilat.

44
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,640
一位有能力的候選人 我們喜歡她
A capable candidate. We like her.

45
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,640
使者 請轉達我們的哀悼
Carry our condolences forward, Ambassador.

46
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,730
并告知格拉特 川陀永遠歡迎她的來臨
And inform Gilat she's always welcome on Trantor.

47
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,690
關于繼任者 大帝
On the topic of a successor, Empire,

48
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,950
存在一些爭議
there is some debate.

49
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,950
另一位候選人的呼聲頗高
Another candidate has been gaining support.

50
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,410
澤菲爾哈利瑪
Zephyr Halima.

51
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,620
哈利瑪伊法不遵從既成的教規
Halima Ifa does not adhere to accepted doctrine,

52
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,330
與過去的比鄰星教宗不同
as have our previous proximas.

53
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,170
她倡導回到《元八開經》
She is advocating for a return to the Primary Octavo.

54
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,760
她是自尋死路嗎 
Is she suicidal?

55
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,010
這女人是誰 膽敢質疑我們的根基 
Who is this woman to question our primacy?

56
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,970
請恕罪 大帝 我…
A-A-Apologies, Empire. I-I--

57
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,180
-你知道這事嗎  -剛剛才知道
-Did you know about this? -Only moments ago.

58
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,560
歐珀的葬禮是什么時候 
When is Opal's funeral?

59
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,350
兩天后 大帝
Two days hence, Empire.

60
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,080
不要對他人提及今天的對話 我們很快會聯系你
Say nothing of this conversation. We will contact you shortly.

61
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,050
前任比鄰星教宗上位時 是我提供了幫助
I helped install the previous Proxima.

62
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,630
我會盡快去和主教團見面
I'll leave for the conclave as soon as possible.

63
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,550
這有必要嗎 你不能用全息影像聯絡 
Is that really necessary? Can't you just holo-cast yourself in?

64
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
這次不行
Not this time.

65
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,520
透光教有三萬億教徒 這次教會分裂需要我親身處理
Luminism claims three trillion followers. This schism requires a personal touch.

66
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,780
《元八開經》是什么 
What's the Primary Octavo?

67
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,950
是異教徒的經文 帝國前時代的
A heretical scripture. Pre-imperial.

68
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,250
它將靈魂與個人知覺連結起來
It directly links the soul to individuated sentience.

69
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,250
-那是什么… -個人知覺
-What does that mean-- -Individuated sentience.

70
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,040
思考 黎明兄弟
Think, Brother Dawn.

71
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,750
如果靈魂僅與一個獨立個體有關
If a soul cleaves only to an individual being,

72
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,130
那么人們會質疑沒有個體性的事物
that calls into question that which cannot be individuated.

73
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,600
所有克里昂大帝 都是一世的完美基因復刻品
All Cleons are perfect genetic copies of the first.

74
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
因此…
And therefore…

75
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,180
我們沒有靈魂
We don't have souls.

76
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,270
所以這個叫哈利瑪的女人是說我們…
So, this Halima woman is saying we're, what?

77
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,900
沒有人性 
Not human?

78
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,570
間接的意思是這樣 但…
Indirectly. But--

79
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,650
如果星系的民眾開始認為
And if the galaxy comes to believe

80
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,950
領袖不如他們 而不是比他們更優越
their leaders are less than, rather than more than themselves,

81
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,740
民眾也許不會再追隨帝國
they may cease to follow.

82
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,330
我們是一艘玻璃船
We are a glass vessel…

83
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,130
由一只靈巧的手控制
spun with a fine hand.

84
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,180
如果內部壓力開始紊亂并且我們不團結
If the pressures inside start to swirl and we are not uniform…

85
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,600
我們也許會爆炸
we may burst.

86
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,810
-你是誰  -塞佛哈定
-Who are you? -Salvor Hardin.

87
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,400
端點星的守衛者
Warden of Terminus.

88
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,740
安納克里昂人不得進入帝國的領土
Anacreons aren't allowed on imperial soil.

89
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,910
你來這里做什么 
What are you doing here?

90
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,370
拾荒
Scrapping.

91
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,920
很少看見拾荒者披盔戴甲
That's a lot of armor for scrappers.

92
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
我們在找這艘船的導航模組
We're looking for the ship's navigation module.

93
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,960
這艘廢船上的任何關鍵部件 早在數十年前就被拆走了
Any critical components were stripped from this hulk decades ago.

94
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,800
不過一位真正的拾荒者會知道這點
But, again, a real scrapper would know that.

95
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,510
你應該離開 趁帝國還未得知此事
You should leave. Before the Empire catches wind of this.

96
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,510
我族人并不畏懼帝國
My people do not fear the Empire.

97
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,140
聽著 你們沒想到會碰到我
Look, I caught you by surprise

98
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,600
所以你們在臨時想辦法
and now you're improvising.

99
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,360
但如果你們要殺我 你們早就動手了
But if you were gonna kill me, you would have already.

100
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,740
接下來的計劃是 
So what's the play?

101
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,290
那座塔 帶我們去那里
That tower. Take us there.

102
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,410
為什么 
Why?

103
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,380
我還是說清吧 守衛者
Let me be clear, Warden.

104
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,210
我們知道如何利用一切可用的資源
We know how to use every resource we come across.

105
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,460
我們早前觀察那幾個孩子
The children we observed earlier,

106
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,130
我們看到他們在黎明前夕偷偷溜走
we've seen how they sneak away just before dawn,

107
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,720
遠離了你們其他人
straying far away from the rest of your flock.

108
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,220
如果你不帶我們去那座塔 我們只需利用其中一個孩子就行 很簡單
If you won't lead us to the tower, we'll simply utilize one of them.

109
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,520
沒那么簡單 那里有圍欄
It's not that simple. We have a fence.

110
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,890
我們知道你們有圍欄
We're aware of your fence.

111
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
我們看到你之前在那里進行維護工作
We saw you perform maintenance on it earlier.

112
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,650
所以你是帶我們穿越圍欄的完美人選
Which makes you the perfect person to take us through it.

113
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,490
那就去塔那里吧
To the tower then!

114
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,340
我們在圍欄上使用了基因識別技術
The fence uses DNA recognition.

115
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,420
任何不在數據庫里的人都會被輻射擊中
It'll radiate anyone who isn't in the database.

116
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,680
我可以帶一個人進去
I might be able to get one of you in.

117
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,060
如果我們一起穿越
If we walk through together,

118
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,480
圍欄會將第二人視作系統錯誤
the fence should write off the second person as an error.

119
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,730
那就帶我們所有人進去
Then take us all through it.

120
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,230
這招只能用一次 可能吧
This only works once. Maybe.

121
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,740
我過去曾拖進圍欄的生物已經死了
The only thing I've ever dragged through this fence was already dead.

122
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,170
我能感到你的緊張 別緊張
I can feel you tensing up. Don't.

123
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,670
如果她在這一輪值班結束前沒回來 我們會夷平你的城市
If she isn't back within a watch, we'll raze your city to the ground.

124
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,650
去 叫上其他人
Go. Get the others.

125
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,520
建立一個防線 別讓人看見
Establish a perimeter and stay out of sight.

126
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,700
你來駕駛 我拿槍 
Wanna drive and I'll hold the gun?

127
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,050
至少告訴我你的名字吧
Tell me your name, at least.

128
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,300
我們成了好朋友了 
Are we best friends now?

129
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,340
你冒很大的險來這里
You've risked a lot coming here.

130
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,760
我們賭上了一切 守衛者
We've risked everything, Warden.

131
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,770
-不 前方路上有個男孩 -別耍花招 我有眼睛
-No. There was a boy in our path! -Don't get cute. I have eyes.

132
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,950
塔在那邊
The tower's that way.

133
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,120
這是捷徑 這條路的守衛比較少
I'm taking a shortcut. Fewer watchmen this way.

134
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,250
那是什么 
What is that?

135
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,220
停下
Stop.

136
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,510
停下
Stop.

137
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,150
關于塞佛哈定的那些傳說  通常從這里開始
The stories about Salvor Hardin? They usually begin here.

138
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,530
守衛者與幽靈
The warden and the ghost,

139
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,740
令人費解地緊密聯系在一起
inexplicably bound together.

140
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
謝謝
Thanks.

141
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,540
他們是怎么避開我們的雷達的 
How did they slip past our radar?

142
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,540
也許是按低空航線飛進來的
Flew in the nap of the earth. Maybe.

143
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,840
有他們飛船的蹤跡嗎 
Any sign of their ships?

144
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,130
他們自稱為拾荒者 說他們在找導航模組
They claimed to be scrappers. Said they were after a navigation module.

145
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,470
-明顯的謊言 -我們必須聯絡帝國
-Obviously bullshit. -We need to contact the Empire.

146
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,050
未經授權 我們不能做任何事
We can't do anything without authorization.

147
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,970
拜托 媽媽 我們只是名義上的帝國哨站
Come on, Mom. We're an imperial outpost in name only.

148
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,350
他們上一次聯絡我們是哪年哪月  十年前了吧 
When was the last time they even contacted us? A decade ago?

149
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,560
他們不會保護我們的 我們必須自己來
They won't defend us. We need to do it ourselves.

150
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,100
別急 暴力是無能者…
Easy. Violence is the last refuge--

151
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,770
最后的庇護所 我知道 那是老人之言
Of the incompetent, I know. That's an old man's doctrine.

152
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,820
那是我比你更年輕時觀察所得的道理
It's an observation I made when I was younger than you.

153
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,150
在哈里的計劃中 我們會等待幫助還是獨立行動 
Would Hari's plan have assumed we'd wait for help or act on our own?

154
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,320
哈里已經不在這了 媽媽 我們必須自救
Hari is not here, Mom. We need to help ourselves.

155
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,330
歡迎醒來 我的好朋友
Welcome back, best friend.

156
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,540
我們正要加深對彼此的了解時你就昏迷了
You left the conversation just as we were really getting to know each other.

157
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,710
頭疼 感覺牙齒要掉了 
Headache? Teeth feel like they're falling out?

158
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,510
那該死的東西是什么 
What was that cursed thing?

159
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,590
我們對端點星殖民時它就在了
It was here when we colonized Terminus.

160
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,260
我們在掃描時沒探測到它 我猜你們也沒有
Didn't show up on any of our scans. I guess it didn't show up on yours either.

161
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,300
為什么你沒有受影響 
Why did it not affect you?

162
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,980
只能說我是你在端點星上最不想碰到的人
Let's just say I'm the last person on Terminus you wanted to come across.

163
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,940
所以…
So…

164
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,770
然后呢 守衛者 
what now, Warden?

165
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,650
她帶了一支小規模軍隊
She had a small army with her.

166
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,940
還有他們的腳印 有的很深
An-- And their tracks, some of them were deep.

167
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,490
步幅較短 好像他們在搬運沉重的設備
Shorter stride lengths. As if they were carrying heavy equipment.

168
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,950
他們似乎計劃在此駐留 爸爸
Like they're planning on digging in, Dad.

169
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,700
-你想怎么做  -不知道
-Well, what do you wanna do? -I don't know.

170
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,210
我一直遵從我的直覺 但…
I've been following my instincts, and--

171
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,920
我不知道 也許那只是碰巧走運
I don't know, maybe it was just dumb luck.

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,380
你的直覺不僅僅帶你上了飛船
Your instincts didn't just lead you to the ships.

173
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,630
而且讓你找到了她 你阻止了她
They led you to her. And you stopped her.

174
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,420
如果你數學更好的話
If you were better at math,

175
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,010
你就會知道反復而來的運氣 就絕不僅是運氣 塞佛
you'd know that repeated luck was more than just luck, Salvor.

176
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,850
無論你母親是否愿意承認
Whether your mother wants to admit it or not,

177
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,930
自從你學會走路起 我們一直跟著你的行為做事
we have been following your lead from the moment you pulled yourself upright.

178
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,520
人們選你擔任守衛者是有原因的
It's no accident the people made you warden.

179
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,230
所以 帶領我們吧
So lead us.

180
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,710
很榮幸初次見到您 大帝 有何可為您效勞 
I have never had the pleasure, Empire. How may I be of service?

181
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,040
你是歐布雷特隊長 
Captain Obrecht, is it?

182
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,540
陰影師 大帝 陰影師歐布雷特
Shadowmaster, Empire. Shadowmaster Obrecht.

183
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,880
非常相像
A fine likeness.

184
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,640
處理有問題的宮殿人員 規程是什么 
What's the protocol for dealing with a problem palace attendant?

185
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,850
請問是哪個級別的人員 
What level of attendant, if I may ask?

186
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,930
-在花園工作的人 -我能問是哪類問題嗎 
-Someone who works in the garden. -May I ask the nature of the problem?

187
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,480
不能 我只需要她的名字
You may not. I just want her name.

188
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,940
沒問題 大帝 若還需要什么 也可以交代我
I can ascertain that, Empire. Along with anything else you may require.

189
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,230
暫時只有這個
That's all for now.

190
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,540
我看到圍欄外至少有十幾個安納克里昂人
I saw at least a dozen Anacreons outside the fence.

191
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,540
特拉維克 從南邊的環圈靠近
Travik, take the southern loop.

192
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,290
凱林 你負責西邊
Kalin, cover the west.

193
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,130
葉特 你守在東邊 監控有沒有人從那個山脊過來
Yate, I want you on the east so you can spot anyone coming over that ridge.

194
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,970
如果看到那些人 我們該做什么 
And if we see any of these guys, what are we supposed to do?

195
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,050
什么都不做
Nothing.

196
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,140
別向他們開槍 別跟他們說話 觀察他們 隨時向我匯報情況
Don't shoot at them, don't speak to them. Just watch 'em and keep me informed.

197
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,850
-端點星出現安納克里昂人是怎么回事  -她叫法拉
-What's this about Anacreons on Terminus? -Calls herself Phara.

198
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,390
除此之外 她的故事完全說不通
Beyond that, nothing about her story adds up.

199
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,810
你最擅長看出別人是否在撒謊了
If anyone can tell whether somebody's lying, it's you.

200
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,190
問題就是這個 我看不出她在撒謊
That's just the thing. I can't tell if she's lying

201
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,020
還是不說實情
or if she's just not telling the truth.

202
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,270
兩者有差別嗎 
Is there a difference?

203
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,990
我有個計劃 但我需要你的幫助
I've got a plan. But I'm gonna need your help.

204
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,160
這是做什么 虐囚 
What's this? Torture?

205
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,620
他是我的男仆從
He's my manservant.

206
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,080
為我跑腿 在需要的時候幫我的靴子封邊
Runs and fetches. Reseals my boots when they need it.

207
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:12,500
我猜對我野外的同伴來說 這一輪值班已經結束了
I'm thinking a watch has passed, as far as my weald-men are concerned.

208
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,960
你到底為何來這里 法拉 
Why are you really here, Phara?

209
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,470
塞佛很擅長讀人心
Salvor has a talent for reading people.

210
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,100
準得嚇人 我剛才還和她母親聊起
It's uncanny, really. I was just telling her mother about it.

211
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,810
她不相信你
She doesn't believe you.

212
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,560
你剛告訴她你是我的上司 這下我像在拍馬屁了
Well, you told her you're my boss. Now my praise rings hollow.

213
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,190
你對基地塔為何感興趣 
What's your interest in the Foundation Tower?

214
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,270
因為模組 我已經告訴你了 你總是問我相同的問題
The module. I already told you. You keep asking me the same questions.

215
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,230
我是在給你機會 讓你回答得更好
I'm giving you a chance to give better answers.

216
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,650
正面
Crowns.

217
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,280
我知道你在找別的東西
I know you're after something else.

218
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,620
我們沒有任何安納克里昂文物 也沒有重型武器 所以到底…
We don't have any Anacreon artifacts, no heavy weapons, so what--

219
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,960
我們在原地繞圈
This is going in circles.

220
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
解釋給她聽
Explain it to her.

221
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,590
把她想要的給她吧
Just give her what she wants.

222
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,750
你的口音不算糟
Your accent's not terrible.

223
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,880
你顯然是向港口城市的人學的
You were taught by someone in the port city, obviously.

224
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,090
懶元音
Those lazy vowels.

225
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,590
我是貿易商
I'm a trader.

226
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,510
我偶爾與你們星球的人做生意
I do business with your people now and then.

227
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,680
怪不得從你身上 我嗅到了狄斯比斯人的味道
Thought I smelled a whiff of Thespin on you.

228
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,730
我要導航模組 僅此而已
I want the navigation module. That's it.

229
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,980
又是一個謊言
Another lie.

230
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,860
你也說安納克里昂語 
You speak Anacreon as well?

231
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,020
一個字都不懂
Not a word.

232
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,690
-但你知道我在撒謊  -反面
-Yet you know I'm lying? -Cats.

233
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,240
概率是二分之一
That was a 50-50 chance.

234
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,700
又是反面 你到底是誰 
Cats again. Who are you really?

235
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,330
概率是四分之一
Twenty-five percent chance there.

236
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,700
又回到正面了
Now it's back to crowns.

237
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,790
八分之一了 又一個正面 你為什么來這里 
Twelve and a half percent. And another crown. Why are you here?

238
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,920
又是正面
Another crown again.

239
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,480
我可以把概率告訴你 但是反復而來的運氣絕不是運氣
I'd give you the percentage, but repeated luck is never luck.

240
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,730
你是誰 
Who are you?

241
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,700
我們是拾荒者 為找模組而來
We're scrappers. The module.

242
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,820
你們不是拾荒者 導航模組不過是為了轉移…
You're not scrappers. And the navigation module's a distraction--

243
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,530
別再玩這些幼稚的把戲了
Enough of these child games.

244
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,290
把這個狄斯比斯暴徒的鏈子解開 讓他直接動手吧
Take this Thespin thug off his leash and let him get on with it!

245
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,370
你的疤痕…
Your scars…

246
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,670
蟹足腫
keloids.

247
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,050
你的左眼…
Your left eye…

248
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,630
納米玻璃
nano-glass.

249
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,510
你是在帝國轟炸安納克里昂時 失去左眼的吧 
You lose it when the Empire bombed Anacreon?

250
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,760
你當時應該是五、六歲 
I imagine you must have been, what, five, six at the time?

251
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,520
中子彈的爆發力較低 但是電離輻射的能量很高
Neutron bombs have a low explosive yield but a high amount of ionizing radiation.

252
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,650
我知道大約一半的人口一周內就死去了
Now, I know about 50% of the population died off within a week,

253
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,780
另外的兩、三成人在那一年里死去
another 20 or 30 within the remaining year.

254
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,110
你很可能在那次轟炸后 成為孤兒了 對吧 
Odds are you came out the other end an orphan, right?

255
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,160
也許失去了爸媽
Probably lost a mom and dad.

256
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,120
活活地被燒死
Boiled alive.

257
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,920
也許是慢性死亡
Or maybe s-slower.

258
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,710
癌癥
Cancer.

259
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,970
你的母親是甲狀腺癌 她的嗓音在死前變了
Thyroid for your mother. Her voice, it changed before she died.

260
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,680
你還失去了誰 姐妹 
Who else did you lose? A sister?

261
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,890
一個兄弟
A brother.

262
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,810
一個弟弟
A little brother.

263
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,540
她的內心有一種死亡的氣息 就像…
There's a deadness inside her. It's like a--

264
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,920
沒有底的井 將一切吸入
It's like a well with no bottom, just sucking everything in.

265
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,800
她想死
She wants to die.

266
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,100
她想讓所有人死 我感覺到了
She wants everyone to die. I felt it.

267
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,060
她在崩潰時說了什么 你聽懂了嗎 
What she said when she broke, did you understand any of it?

268
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,770
聽懂了一些 是古安納克里昂語 不是通用語
Some, yeah. It's archaic Anacreon, not the common vernacular.

269
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,230
她說漏嘴了 因為我也聽懂了一些話
Well, she slipped up. Because I understood something too.

270
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,570
一個我曾在全息影像見過的名字 拉肯柯恩
A name I remember from the holos. Larken Keaen.

271
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,040
在安鐸星帶糾紛事件時
During the Anthor Belt dispute,

272
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,370
安納克里昂和狄斯比斯為帝國帶去貢禮
Anacreon and Thespis brought gifts to the Emperor.

273
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,960
我族人帶的是《洗禮經》
My people's was the Book of Ablut--

274
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,330
安納克里昂的是一把 為其最偉大獵手雕刻的弓
And Anacreon's was a bow carved for its greatest hunter.

275
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,630
-拉肯柯恩 -意思是 
-Larken Keaen. -Meaning?

276
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,460
法拉不是什么撿垃圾的
Phara's not just some junker.

277
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,170
她是安納克里昂的大獵手
She's the Grand Huntress of Anacreon.

278
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,600
這一切動亂到底是誰造成的 
All this unrest, who's responsible for it?

279
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,940
墮落者 這是一個化名
Sinkers. A nom de guerre.

280
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,990
77層的熱沉室熔化后 那是星橋墜落造成的
After the heat sink meltdown on level 77. It was caused when the Star Bridge fell.

281
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,950
35年后 我們仍在處理這件事的余波
And 35 years later we're still grappling with the aftereffects.

282
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,580
大帝的職責就是 處理一堆相互競爭優先級的事項
The businesses of Empire is a cascade of competing priorities.

283
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,420
我和主教團會面時 白晝兄弟將會需要你的幫助
Brother Day will need your support while I tend to the conclave.

284
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,590
公務太繁多
It's overwhelming.

285
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,880
對于一個人而言
For one man.

286
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,510
幸運的是我們有三個人
Fortunately, there are three of us.

287
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,260
壞事往往成三 你聽說了嗎 兄弟 
Bad tidings also come in threes. Have you heard the news, Brother?

288
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,940
大角星區有一個通訊浮標斷聯了
A communications buoy in the Arcturus Sector has come off-line.

289
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,980
那些浮標應該常常斷聯吧 
They must go off-line all the time, right?

290
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,360
我們大概有幾千個浮標遍布整個星系
We probably have thousands of them across the galaxy.

291
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,690
數萬個
Tens of thousands.

292
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,030
但只有那個浮標負責外圍星域的通訊
But only one that handles communications in the Outer Reach.

293
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,620
你沒有理解此事的嚴重性
I see that you fail to grasp the significance.

294
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,740
是端點星
It's Terminus.

295
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,790
黃昏兄弟將哈里謝頓的信徒流放到那里
It's where Brother Dusk exiled Hari Seldon's followers.

296
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,260
外圍星域、主教團、叛變
The Reach. The conclave. Insurgency…

297
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,220
你看出這一系列事情的規律了嗎 
Do you see a pattern forming here?

298
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
給他們看看
Show them.

299
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,350
感知到你們的脆弱后 很快將有其他力量 開始對帝國進行破壞
Sensing vulnerability, soon other players will begin to apply downward pressure.

300
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,690
銀河中某個主要的宗教必然會發起煽動
An exhortation from one of the galaxy's major religions is a given.

301
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,610
也可能是川陀本地發起的起義
Or perhaps a homegrown insurrection here on Trantor.

302
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,870
如果滅亡的速度可以加快 那可以減慢嗎 
If the fall can be accelerated, can it not also be slowed?

303
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,080
瞧瞧你現在 兄弟
Now look at you, Brother.

304
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,580
坐在中央王座上 剛愎自用的樣子
So smugly self-assured atop the middle throne.

305
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,000
我以前會在鏡子前練習這個笑容
I used to practice that smile in the mirror.

306
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,170
夠了 我知道這一幕的結局
Enough. I know how the scene ends.

307
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,040
但你領會了其中的教訓嗎 
But have you embraced its lessons?

308
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,130
透光教 如今墮落者起義了
Luminism. The Sinker insurrection happening now.

309
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,760
謝頓幾乎給你列了一份待做事項清單
Seldon all but drew you a to-do list.

310
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,010
你卻完全無視
And you ignored him.

311
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,720
因為他是個江湖騙子
Because he was a charlatan.

312
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,560
你沒有任何新的創造
You offer nothing new.

313
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,020
不過是一個更嫩的葡萄
Just a younger grape…

314
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,730
來自同一個葡萄藤
from the same vine,

315
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,060
注定釀成同樣的酒
destined for the same old bottle.

316
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,230
你們無法拯救自己
You can't save yourselves…

317
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
但你們能拯救功業 傳承后世
but you can save your legacy.

318
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,990
哈里謝頓已死去多時
Hari Seldon is long dead.

319
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,450
而且是被自己的學徒殺死的
Murdered by his protégé, no less.

320
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,160
人是死了 但是阻止得了起義嗎 兄弟 
The man was murdered. But what about the movement, Brother?

321
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,630
烈士的影響力往往超越其本身的生命長度
Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.

322
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,220
因為你 我們所看到的是 一個真正的外交危機的開始
Thanks to you, we are now staring down the barrel of a genuine diplomatic crisis.

323
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,260
我該做什么 路易斯 
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?

324
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,140
讓法拉殺了我 然后對孩子們動手 
Let Phara kill me and then move on to the kids?

325
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,850
你不該在我不在場的情況下拷問她
You shouldn't have questioned her without me.

326
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,600
你應慶幸 我們知道她的身份了
Be glad I did. We know who she is now.

327
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,690
我們有籌碼了 可以與她的同伴討價還價
We have leverage. We can bargain with her people.

328
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,570
如果這個選擇讓全城陷入暴動
If this choice inflames the city into violence,

329
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,530
你成功讓我們如此高明地自取滅亡
you have achieved elaborate suicide for us all.

330
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,990
哈里不是說基地會在 第一次危機中存活嗎 
Didn't Hari say the Foundation survives the first crisis?

331
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,870
沒錯 但正如我曾告訴你的 你是異類
Yes, he did. But, as I've told you before, you are an outlier.

332
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,080
-意思是  -塞佛
-Meaning? -Salvor.

333
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,740
意思是計算結果不包括你
Meaning that you weren't accounted for.

334
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,290
你與穹窿有一種聯結
You have a connection with the Vault

335
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,620
而那是不可能被預測的
which couldn't have possibly have been predicted.

336
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,170
模型中沒有你
You are not baked into the model.

337
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,710
意思是我不屬于上帝的計劃
You're saying I'm not part of God's plan.

338
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,040
意思是心理歷史學無法計算個人行為
I am saying psychohistory can't account for individuals.

339
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,630
所以你是說我毀了上帝的計劃 
So you're saying I've destroyed God's plan?

340
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,050
-是時候后退一步了 塞佛 -退一步 
-It's time to take a step back, Salvor. -Step back?

341
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,090
我以為基地存在的全部意義
I thought the whole damn point of the Foundation

342
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,550
在于為難以預料的情況做準備
was preparing for the unthinkable.

343
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,720
在我要求更多防御武器時
When I asked for more defensive weapons,

344
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,350
你說襲擊的可能性極低
you said the likelihood of an attack seemed remote.

345
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,480
在我提出進行更多軍事訓練時 沒人回應
When I wanted to run more drills, nothing.

346
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,850
結果我們走到這一步 毫無準備
So here we are now, not prepared.

347
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,150
也許我是異類 但搞砸計劃的不是我 路易斯
I might be an outlier, but I'm not the one screwing up the Plan, Lewis.

348
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,410
這是總督路易斯皮仁恩
Lewis Pirenne, director.

349
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,410
安納克里昂議事會為什么派最高級的軍官
Now, why would the Anacreon Council send its highest-ranking military officer

350
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,290
到一個帝國哨站 
to an imperial outpost?

351
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,960
這是你們的末日邪教偽裝出來的門面嗎 
Is that what you're pretending your little doomsday cult is?

352
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
因為我在這里看不見帝國的影子
Because I don't see the Empire anywhere.

353
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,550
我只看到學者、勞工和極少的槍械
All I see are academics, laborers and very few guns.

354
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,920
你們破壞了通訊浮標
You took down the comms buoy.

355
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,550
當然 我們想暗中行動 避開監控
Of course. We wanted to operate in private, away from prying eyes.

356
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,720
你要明白帝國最終會派人來調查的
You have to know the Empire will send someone to investigate eventually.

357
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,850
還是說那就是你的意圖 
Or is that the point?

358
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,770
你們這里的女性比男性聰明多了
Your women are so much sharper than your men.

359
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,690
蠻族王國被流放了 你們沒有理由來這里
The barbarian kingdoms are exiled. You have no business here.

360
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,650
“蠻族”
"Barbarians."

361
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,950
不過是個用在異類身上的 歧視詞語 真是方便
Just a convenient slur for anyone not like you.

362
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,120
川陀讓我們在這里自生自滅 你的人和我的人
Trantor left us all here to die. Your people and mine.

363
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,990
我們不過是以不同的速度滅亡
We're just dying at different speeds.

364
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,410
基地沒有滅亡
The Foundation isn't dying.

365
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,080
我們要完成哈里謝頓托付我們的任務
We are fulfilling the mission Hari Seldon entrusted us with.

366
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,840
謝頓也預測到滅亡將會從銀河邊緣開始
Seldon also predicted that the fall would begin at the edge of the galaxy.

367
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,380
-這里 -同樣的科學計算
-Here. -The same science

368
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,470
在星橋墜落時拯救了帝國宮殿
that saved the Imperial Palace when the Star Bridge fell

369
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,760
也保護著端點市
protects Terminus City.

370
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,260
你是說你的能量屏障 
You mean your energy barrier?

371
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,390
武器的效用取決于使用者的能耐
A weapon's only as good as the man who's wielding it.

372
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,870
凱林 你那邊情況如何 
Kalin, what's your situation?

373
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,870
這里的人越來越多了
It's getting pretty crowded over here.

374
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,200
-我可能需要支援 -不可能
-I think I need backup. -Not happening.

375
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,580
塞佛看到十幾個人 你是說 到處都是安納克里昂人 
Salvor saw a dozen. You're telling me we've got Anacreons all over?

376
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,500
我是說我看到他們攜帶的槍械 足以將整座城夷為平地
I'm telling you I'm seeing enough guns to take out the whole town.

377
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
大帝
Empire.

378
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,630
我們討論的問題 
The matter we discussed?

379
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,470
她叫阿祖拉歐蒂利 13歲起成為宮殿植物學家
Her name is Azura Odili. A palace botanist since the age of 13.

380
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,520
她的父親已身故 生前也是花園的農業生態學家
Her father, deceased, was also an agroecologist in the gardens.

381
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,270
她的母親創辦了一所插花學校 目前已關閉了
Her mother founded a school for the ikebana, now closed.

382
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,190
你是說有什么問題嗎 
You said there was a problem?

383
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,150
在這種情況下通常怎么解決問題 
How are problems generally solved in this situation?

384
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,410
只要能達到目的就可以 我的職責是讓問題消失 大帝
Any manner that achieves its goal. My job is to eliminate problems, Empire.

385
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,800
阿祖拉歐戴利
Azura Odili.

386
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
歐迪利 歐德利 
Oh-dee-lee? Oh-dih-lee?

387
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,850
蒂 大帝
Dee, Empire.

388
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,850
你之前在我的寢宮外
You were outside my chambers earlier.

389
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,060
-我想知道你認為自己看見了什么 -我什么都沒看見 大帝
-Want to know what you think you saw. -I saw nothing, Empire.

390
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,900
不 我認為你看見了一些東西
No. I believe you saw something.

391
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,150
我只看見大帝希望我看見的
I only see what Empire wants me to see.

392
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,480
我可以罷免你的職務
I could have you removed from your station,

393
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,740
送你去80層清理熱沉室
sent to scrub the heat sinks on level 80.

394
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,070
我可以對你下狠手 遠比這更狠
I could do worse to you. Much worse.

395
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,370
你很清楚
You know all this.

396
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,950
大帝 黃昏兄弟讓我來請你過去
Empire, Brother Dusk has asked me to summon you.

397
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,370
告訴他我馬上過去
Tell him I'm coming.

398
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,830
把這個花圃都移除
Remove this entire bed.

399
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,210
在我的寢宮 花的香氣太濃郁了
From my chambers the smell of the blossoms is overbearing.

400
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,470
-大帝 這種事不需要你… -已經解決了 你走吧
-Empire, you needn't bother with this-- -It's settled. You can go.

401
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,930
狼息葉有助緩解疼痛
Wolvesbreath helps with the pain.

402
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
是帶紅色條紋的褐綠色葉子
The brownish-green leaves with the red stripe.

403
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,100
它們能緩解腫脹和淤傷…
They reduce the swelling and bruising--

404
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,640
我不記得向你征求醫療建議
I don't recall asking for your medical advice.

405
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
是哪種 
Which?

406
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,710
尖葉
The pointed leaves.

407
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,730
這是什么 
What is it?

408
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,850
狼靈屬
Lupi spiritus.

409
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,940
這是狼息葉 大帝 來自我們的草藥園
Wolvesbreath, Empire. From our medicinal garden.

410
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,820
是一種鎮痛劑和血管舒張藥
It's an analgesic and vasodilator.

411
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,990
有毒嗎 
Is it poisonous?

412
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,320
沒有 狼息葉可以泡茶或釀藥酒
No. Wolvesbreath is used in tea as well as tinctures.

413
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,700
它能刺激血管、促進康復…
It stimulates the blood vessels, promotes healing--

414
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,950
吃下去
Eat it.

415
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,670
如果接下來的幾個小時你沒死
If you're not dead within the next few hours,

416
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,880
就送1公斤到我的寢宮來
have a kilogram of these sent to my quarters.

417
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,170
是 大帝
Of course, Empire.

418
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,430
雷洛弗拉姆 馬上回家
Laylo Fulham, get your ass back home this instant!

419
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
他們會突破嗎 
Are they gonna get through?

420
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,680
當然不會
Course not.

421
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,900
大家都回家去 拜托了 這里不安全 快后退…
Go back to your home, people. Please. It's not safe out here. Back up. Back up.

422
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,190
你們必須立即離開
You need to come out here. Now.

423
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,360
我挺忙的 葉特
Kind of busy here, Yate.

424
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,990
我知道 但我還是要打給你
I know, and I'm still calling.

425
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:11,240
安納克里昂軍隊在東邊、西邊、南邊集結
We've got Anacreon's troops massing from the east, west, south,

426
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,080
估計北邊也有
and presumably the north.

427
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,830
還記得怎么拿槍嗎 老頭 
Remember how to hold a rifle, old man?

428
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,000
槍管對著前方 
Barrel goes forward?

429
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,460
我們在圍欄外的多個地點 發現安納克里昂人
We've spotted Anacreons at multiple locations outside the fence.

430
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,840
-我去西邊 -我們去北邊
-I'll go west. -We'll head north.

431
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,720
我不應該離開 路易斯完全不是對手
I shouldn't leave. Lewis is completely overmatched in there.

432
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,260
我會照顧他的 我保證
I'll babysit him, I promise.

433
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,300
好吧
All right.

434
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,260
是真的嗎 里面有安納克里昂的頭目 
Is it true? You got some kind of Anacreon chieftain in there?

435
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,600
你喝酒了嗎 穆勒 
You been drinking, Muller?

436
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,850
銀河系要完蛋了 是嗎  哈里的預測成真了
It's the end of the galaxy, isn't it? Hari's prediction's coming true.

437
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,360
你聽到的是謠言 穆勒 只是一個本地的盜獵者
You got hold of a bad rumor, Muller. Local poacher's all.

438
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,020
他們已經到了 對吧 
They're already here, aren't they?

439
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,360
嘿 不如你歇一下吧 
Hey, why don't you just take a break for a second.

440
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
嘿
Hey!

441
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,960
我不會傷害你的
I won't hurt you.

442
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,550
告訴我你是誰
Just tell me who you are.

443
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,630
塞
Sal.

444
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,140
塞
Sal.

445
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,720
塞 嘿…怎么回事 
Sal. Hey, hey. What's wrong?

446
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,770
我剛才在川陀的帝國圖書館
I was just in the Imperial Library on Trantor.

447
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,810
-什么叫你在那里  -我身處那里 在書架間
-What do you mean you were there? -I mean I was there. In the stacks.

448
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,600
天花板是木制的 還有很多大理石半身像
The ceiling was wooden, there were all these marble busts.

449
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,270
有個拿著刀的男孩
And there was a boy with a knife.

450
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,070
是帶我找到安納克里昂人的那個男孩
It was the same boy who led me to the Anacreons.

451
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,450
是穹窿 我能感覺到它 雨果 它想告訴我些什么
It's the Vault. I can feel it, Hugo. It's trying to tell me something

452
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,580
關于安納克里昂人和這次危機 關于一切
about the Anacreons and this crisis. Everything.

453
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,540
好的 聽我說 我過去總說 你應該離開這個星球
Okay, listen to me. I've always said you should let this planet shrug you off.

454
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,210
但看到你做的事 你竟能感知 法拉內心的想法
But watching you work, where you could sense what Phara was feeling inside…

455
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
這很特別
that's special.

456
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,180
塞 別的人不可能做到這點
Other people can't do that, Sal.

457
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,890
我對你有百分之百的信心
I have absolute faith in you.

458
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,970
我對你有百分之百的信心
I have absolute faith in you.

459
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,040
你們中的誰是統計學大師提沃爾 
Who among you is Master Statistician Tivole?

460
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,130
大帝 愿明光永不滅
Empire. May the light never dim.

461
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,760
愿明光永不滅
May the light never dim.

462
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,550
-你收到我的征詢了 -是 大帝
-You received my query. -I did, Empire.

463
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,800
但我們尚未得到結果
But I can't say yet we have the results.

464
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,930
黃昏給你安排這項任務后已經過了多久 
How long has it been since Dusk set you to this task?

465
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,640
30年 
Three decades?

466
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,900
你在你那數字陵墓里都忙些什么
What do you do in your mausoleum of calculus

467
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,270
為何還沒有結果 
if not achieve results?

468
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,570
那就說進展吧 你有何進展 
Progress, then. What is your progress?

469
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,040
我們認為哈里謝頓的預測模型 是違背事實的
We believe the-- the predictive models of Hari Seldon to be counterfactual.

470
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,750
為什么這么說 
And you believe this why?

471
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:11,340
在謝頓發表他的異教學說后的35年來
In the 35 years since Seldon uttered his heretical proclamations,

472
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,840
帝國擴張了 而不是收縮 無論是以哪個重要的參數…
the Imperium has expanded, rather than contracted, by every critical metric--

473
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,930
夠了
Stop.

474
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,560
謝頓的預言
Seldon's prophecies.

475
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,270
和我說說他的數學計算 這個“序數分析”
Speak to me of his math, this "ordinal analysis."

476
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,020
不過是一幅占卜牌
It's a spread of fortune teller's cards

477
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,070
謝頓選擇將其詮釋為神旨
which Seldon chose to interpret as divination.

478
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,700
他在回歸模型中發現的證明 并沒有證據所支持
The verification he found in the regression models is unsupported.

479
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,580
但是近期的種種事件怎么說 
But what of these-- these recent events?

480
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,950
主教團 透光教 
The conclave? Luminism?

481
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,210
毫無根據的猜想 同樣是模糊而沒有證據支持的
Baseless conjecture. Again, vague and unsupported.

482
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,630
任何人都能預測到回到正教這件事
I mean, anyone could predict a return to orthodoxy.

483
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,220
心理歷史學只是老人空想出來的研究
Psychohistory is the fanciful work of an old man's imagination.

484
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,930
如果它并非老人空想出來的研究 那么是什么 
If it weren't the fanciful work of an old man's imagination, what then?

485
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,970
研究最終被證為真實的概率是多少 
What is the likelihood that it's all true? Every prophecy?

486
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,980
微小得可以忽略 大帝
Vanishingly small, Empire.

487
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,390
但不是零
But not zero.

488
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,980
對嗎 
Correct?

489
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,980
非零 
Not zero?

490
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,910
你們到底是什么白癡 
What kind of idiots are you?

491
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,160
一千個帝國數學家
A thousand imperial mathematicians…

492
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,120
卻理解不了一個人的計算 
…can't parse the numbers of one man?

493
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,670
所以銀河系中沒有任何人有辦法 
So there's nothing anyone in the galaxy can do?

494
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,880
這是你們交出的最佳結果 
Is that what it is? Is that the best you've got?

495
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,680
告訴我…
Tell me. Tell me!

496
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,470
告訴我
Tell me!

497
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,650
在人生的晚年
In the twilight of a man's life…

498
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,410
當他的個人歷史將近尾聲時
…when his biography is nearly complete,

499
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,580
他開始絕望地想知道他的人生
he grows desperate to know the measure of his days…

500
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,160
他的聲音與前人所有的聲音相比結果如何
how his voice compares to the chorus of those who've come before.

501
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,050
我重要嗎 我的選擇是自己做出的嗎 
Do I matter? Are my choices my own?

502
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,590
我的命運是否被看不見的手所左右 
Or is my destiny governed by an unseen hand?

503
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,730
白晝兄弟 來為我們送行 
Brother Day. Come to see us off?

504
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,610
你的統計師們來找過我
I was paid a visit by your statisticians.

505
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,610
他們的計算結果如此自圓其說 真了不起
It's remarkable how self-reinforcing their results are.

506
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,080
我認為你最好還是留在川陀處理事務
I think it's best that you stay and tend to matters on Trantor.

507
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,540
大帝 第一克里昂從未離開過川陀
Empire, a primary Cleon has not left the bosom of Trantor

508
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,750
從一脈相承的王朝開始起就沒有過
since the dawn of the Genetic Dynasty.

509
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,830
德默澤爾是對的
Demerzel is right.

510
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,500
我們訂立這些規程是有原因的
We have these protocols in place for a reason.

511
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:03,180
我則認為我們的規程讓我們懈怠了
And I say our protocols have made us complacent.

512
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,970
當年你和我現在一樣坐在中央王座上
When you sat on the middle throne, as I do now,

513
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,470
討論如何處理安納克里昂和狄斯比斯時
and were debating what to do about Anacreon and Thespis,

514
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,770
我們該如何回應 你記得 你當時是怎么說的嗎 
what our response should be, do you remember what you said?

515
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,230
記得
I do.

516
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,690
仿佛是昨日
Like it was yesterday.

517
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,530
那時我七歲
I was seven.

518
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,700
我們最年長的兄弟認為應該恩赦
Our eldest brother had argued for a bout of grace.

519
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,530
你轉向我說 “你如何看此事 初升的黎明 ”
You turned to me and said, "What do you think, Ascending Dawn?"

520
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,330
我知道你反對恩赦
I knew you were against grace,

521
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,870
你想轟炸蠻族王國
that you wanted to bomb the barbarian kingdoms.

522
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,130
但我很怕 我大膽說了出來
But I was scared. And I dared say so.

523
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,380
如今我已經不怕了
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

524
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:45,090
在你的統治下 星橋墜落 在那件事的傷疤上 人們掀起起義
On your watch, the Star Bridge fell. And from that scar insurgency was birthed.

525
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,600
在你的統治下 兩個世界燒為灰燼
On your watch, two worlds were incinerated

526
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,220
完全不顧及無辜者或后果
with not a care to innocence or consequence.

527
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,730
在你的統治下 哈里謝頓和他的信眾得以逃離
On your watch, Hari Seldon and his followers were allowed to flee.

528
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,690
你把一個因為任性妄為 而四分五裂的帝國交到我手上
You have bequeathed me an Empire rent by impulsive action.

529
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,690
我不會重蹈覆轍 在我的統治下不會這樣
The same will not be said of me. Not on my watch.

530
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,700
我將拯救我們的功業
I would save our legacy.

531
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
兄弟
Brother…

532
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,370
一個早已死去的人 陰魂不散 令你無法釋懷
you are haunted by the ghost of a man long dead.

533
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,710
我們都是如此 兄弟
We all are, Brother.

534
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,090
你的統治已經結束
Your watch is over.

535
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,880
你將留在川陀 處理你放任不管 而因此惡化的傷口
You will stay on Trantor, tending to the wounds you have allowed to fester.

536
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,970
走吧
Go.

537
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,520
把黃昏兄弟的物品送回宮殿
Return Brother Dusk's belongings to the palace.

538
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,660
如今帝國當然不會因莽撞行事而分崩離析
Certainly now the Empire will no longer be rent by impulsive action.

539
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,980
是你召喚我嗎 大帝 
You summoned me, Empire?

540
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,770
外圍星域的一個通訊浮標斷聯了
A communications buoy has gone dark in the Outer Reach.

541
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,570
帶上你的團隊去調查
Take your team and investigate.

542
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,610
這就去 大帝
At once, Empire.

543
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,110
多爾文
Dorwin.

544
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,700
基地通訊的頻率越來越少了
Our dispatches from the Foundation have become sporadic.

545
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,870
去造訪他們
Pay them a visit.

546
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,830
提醒基地 不要對帝國有所隱瞞
And remind the Foundation that Empire will not be kept in the dark.

547
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,230
-那是… -情況不太妙 是吧 
-Is that, uh-- -Doesn't look good, does it?

548
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,130
這里由誰指揮 路易斯還是你  還是玩硬幣的守衛者 
Who is in charge here, Lewis? You? Or is it the Warden with the coin tricks?

549
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,550
因為她似乎讓情況變得復雜了
Because it seems she's managed to complicate matters.

550
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,970
-讓我說清楚 獵手柯恩 -大獵手
-Let me be clear, Huntress Keaen-- -Grand Huntress.

551
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,590
我們面臨危機的唯一原因
The only reason we have a crisis

552
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,140
是你們擅自入侵帝國的私人領域
is because you trespassed on the Emperor's personal domain.

553
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,430
如果塞佛當時帶我去塔那邊 把我要的東西給我
If only Salvor had taken me to the tower and given me what I'd wanted,

554
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,140
我們早都離開這個星球了
we'd already be off-planet.

555
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,730
我們慢速艦上的模組 
The module from our slow ship?

556
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,320
你們的人又不會用它
It's not as if your people have any use for it.

557
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,400
你們已經困在端點星了 帝國確保這一點
You're marooned on Terminus. The Empire made sure of that.

558
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,820
路易斯
Lewis.

559
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
你們為何需要模組 
Why do you need it?

560
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,450
我族人在科技上極其匱乏
My people are technologically bankrupt.

561
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,160
我們要滅亡了 總督
We're dying, Director.

562
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,460
自從帝國讓我們的大氣層燃燒后 我們一直苦苦掙扎
We have been ever since the Empire set our atmosphere on fire.

563
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,380
因為一個并非我們犯下的罪行 一半人口失去生命
Half our population lost for a crime that we were innocent of.

564
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,300
和你們不同 我們有飛船
Unlike you, we have ships.

565
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,970
我們能夠離開被摧毀的世界 尋找另一個恒星系
We can leave our poisoned world, find another star system.

566
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,220
我們只需要在虛空中導航的工具
If only we had the means to navigate the void.

567
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,010
如果支援你們 帝國會摧毀我們
The Empire would crush us for assisting you.

568
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,850
我們這是在逼你出手相助 總督
We're forcing your hand, Director.

569
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,730
因為我們已經沒什么可失去的了
Because we have nothing left to lose.

570
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,900
你無法和一個愿意將棋盤燒毀的人下棋
You can't play chess with someone who's willing to set the board on fire.

571
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,940
那是某種高射炮嗎 
Is that some kind of flak cannon?

572
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,610
如果他們以為那能突破圍欄 那就是在浪費時間
Wasting their time if they think that's gonna penetrate the fence.

573
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,160
這一切都不對勁 法拉應該更高明的
None of this feels right. Phara is smarter than this.

574
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,660
他們摧毀了通訊浮標 他們是有備而來
They took out the comms buoy, and they came in prepared.

575
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,410
他們的策略比我們想的大 但我卻看不出到底是什么
There's a larger strategy here, and I am missing it somehow.

576
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,750
不如我乘飛船離開 去其他星球求助 
What if I take my ship, make a run for the stars, get help?

577
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,210
不行…你還沒進入軌道 就會被他們從空中擊落
No, no. They'd shoot you out of the sky before you ever made it into orbit.

578
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,010
后悔沒在還來得及的時候離開了 
Regretting you didn't bug out when you had the chance?

579
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,760
我這輩子做的傻事多了去了 塞佛哈定
Done a lot of foolish things in my life, Salvor Hardin.

580
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,680
陪在你身邊不是其中之一
Sticking by your side is not one of them.

581
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,430
史上最佳男仆從
Best manservant ever.

582
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,280
穹窿并非出自安納克里昂之手
The Vault isn't Anacreon…

583
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,190
也不是外星生物建的
or alien at all.

584
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,740
它一定與哈里有關
It's gotta be connected to Hari.

585
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
你怎么知道 
How do you know that?

586
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,780
因為我昏迷時看到的畫面
Because the vision I saw when I blacked out,

587
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,040
是川陀星 在哈里的圖書館 有個男孩拿刀指著我
it was on Trantor in Hari's library, with a boy holding a knife on me.

588
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,500
也許這是在警告我們遠離它 
What if it was a warning to stay away?

589
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,250
如果路易斯是對的呢 
What if Lewis is right?

590
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,460
正如他所說的 我是異類 橫沖直撞、四處搗亂
I'm an outlier, just like he says, barging around, knocking things over,

591
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,840
搞砸了謝頓的計劃 
screwing up Seldon's plan?

592
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,430
塞佛 如果你就是謝頓的計劃呢 
Salvor, what if you are Seldon's plan?

593
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,390
個人的命運將永遠是一個謎
The fate of one individual will always remain a mystery.

594
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,850
守衛者 還記得我的承諾嗎  夷平你的城市 
Remember my promise, Warden? Razing your city to the ground?

595
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,900
但一群人的行動
But the movements of masses,

596
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,520
文化的興起與消亡 因果與世界…
the rise and falls of cultures, causes and worlds…

597
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,530
對于這些問題 哈里謝頓早已解開謎底
These were answers Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

598
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,490
是時候了
It's time.

599
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,370
如其名字所描述的 這場終結的開始
And the beginning of the end, as befitting its name,

600
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,240
在端點星上發生了
took place on Terminus.

601
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,410
