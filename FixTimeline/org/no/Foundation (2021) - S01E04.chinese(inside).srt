1
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,976
Once, a man came to
Hari Seldon and asked to be told his fate.

2
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,110
He wanted to know

3
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,488
whether the predictive models could chart
the significance of his life.

4
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:02,289
But Hari told him only the movements
of masses could be predicted.

5
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:10,214
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

6
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,468
The clockwork of civilization…

7
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,807
the rise and fall of cultures…

8
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,478
causes and worlds…

9
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,193
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

10
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,949
Belief is a powerful weapon.

11
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,038
That's why the Empire feared
Hari Seldon's predictions so much.

12
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:32,713
Empires govern worldly concerns,
but what comes after? Our souls?

13
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,674
These realms are the purview of faith.

14
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,929
And faith is a sword
forged in the fires of the infinite.

15
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,977
Empire?
Do you seek different amusement?

16
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:33,565
You'll do. For the routine pleasures
in the routine manner.

17
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,235
Which pleasures do you prefer, Empire?

18
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,406
Do you offer the pleasure of nothing?
Is that on the menu?

19
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,160
Is it true? No one's allowed to touch you?

20
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,456
Bold, aren't you?

21
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,294
I have only 24 hours of service to you.
I want to make the most of it.

22
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
Then try to touch me.

23
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,929
I said try.

24
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,709
The aura repels kinetic energy.

25
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:40,090
I want you to try it again,
with a softer touch.

26
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,885
Slower.

27
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,432
Slower.

28
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,451
So, how…

29
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,577
…does the rest work?

30
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,469
What?

31
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,179
You are required, Empire.

32
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,100
I understand Empire has
a physiological need for intimacy.

33
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,811
But the current matter
supersedes this need.

34
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,285
Ambassador Thanwall.

35
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,206
Most esteemed Empire, glory to the light--

36
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,832
Out with it, Ambassador.

37
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,254
Proxima Opal has passed, Empire.

38
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,463
Our condolences.

39
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,590
Condolences. Heartfelt.

40
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,551
Thank you, Empire.

41
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,137
Proxima Opal will be missed
and mourned by her flock.

42
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,433
And now the conclave will elevate
her successor, Zephyr Gilat.

43
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,644
A capable candidate. We like her.

44
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,647
Carry our condolences forward, Ambassador.

45
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,734
And inform Gilat
she's always welcome on Trantor.

46
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,697
On the topic of a successor, Empire,

47
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,950
there is some debate.

48
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,954
Another candidate has been
gaining support.

49
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,415
Zephyr Halima.

50
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,628
Halima Ifa does not adhere to
accepted doctrine,

51
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,339
as have our previous proximas.

52
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:48,177
She is advocating for
a return to the Primary Octavo.

53
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,762
Is she suicidal?

54
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,016
Who is this woman to question our primacy?

55
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,976
A-A-Apologies, Empire. I-I--

56
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,187
-Did you know about this?
-Only moments ago.

57
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,564
When is Opal's funeral?

58
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,357
Two days hence, Empire.

59
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,082
Say nothing of this conversation.
We will contact you shortly.

60
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,052
I helped install the previous Proxima.

61
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,638
I'll leave for the conclave
as soon as possible.

62
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,557
Is that really necessary?
Can't you just holo-cast yourself in?

63
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,642
Not this time.

64
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:42,523
Luminism claims three trillion followers.
This schism requires a personal touch.

65
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,783
What's the Primary Octavo?

66
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,954
A heretical scripture. Pre-imperial.

67
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,250
It directly links the soul
to individuated sentience.

68
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,254
-What does that mean--
-Individuated sentience.

69
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,047
Think, Brother Dawn.

70
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,758
If a soul cleaves only to
an individual being,

71
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:13,136
that calls into question
that which cannot be individuated.

72
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:20,602
All Cleons are
perfect genetic copies of the first.

73
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,687
And therefore…

74
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,189
We don't have souls.

75
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,277
So, this Halima woman is saying
we're, what?

76
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,904
Not human?

77
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,573
Indirectly. But--

78
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,658
And if the galaxy comes to believe

79
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,953
their leaders are less than,
rather than more than themselves,

80
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,746
they may cease to follow.

81
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,336
We are a glass vessel…

82
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,132
spun with a fine hand.

83
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:57,181
If the pressures inside start to swirl
and we are not uniform…

84
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,602
we may burst.

85
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,818
-Who are you?
-Salvor Hardin.

86
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,404
Warden of Terminus.

87
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,745
Anacreons aren't allowed on imperial soil.

88
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,917
What are you doing here?

89
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,376
Scrapping.

90
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,920
That's a lot of armor for scrappers.

91
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,005
We're looking for
the ship's navigation module.

92
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,966
Any critical components were stripped
from this hulk decades ago.

93
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,802
But, again,
a real scrapper would know that.

94
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,515
You should leave.
Before the Empire catches wind of this.

95
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,517
My people do not fear the Empire.

96
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,149
Look, I caught you by surprise

97
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,609
and now you're improvising.

98
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,364
But if you were gonna kill me,
you would have already.

99
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,740
So what's the play?

100
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,290
That tower. Take us there.

101
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,416
Why?

102
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,380
Let me be clear, Warden.

103
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,216
We know how to use
every resource we come across.

104
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,469
The children we observed earlier,

105
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,138
we've seen how they sneak away
just before dawn,

106
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,724
straying far away from
the rest of your flock.

107
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:27,229
If you won't lead us to the tower,
we'll simply utilize one of them.

108
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,523
It's not that simple. We have a fence.

109
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,899
We're aware of your fence.

110
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,985
We saw you
perform maintenance on it earlier.

111
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,655
Which makes you
the perfect person to take us through it.

112
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,490
To the tower then!

113
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,340
The fence uses DNA recognition.

114
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,428
It'll radiate anyone
who isn't in the database.

115
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,685
I might be able to get one of you in.

116
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,061
If we walk through together,

117
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,480
the fence should write off
the second person as an error.

118
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,732
Then take us all through it.

119
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,234
This only works once. Maybe.

120
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,741
The only thing I've ever dragged
through this fence was already dead.

121
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,170
I can feel you tensing up. Don't.

122
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,674
If she isn't back within a watch,
we'll raze your city to the ground.

123
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,651
Go. Get the others.

124
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,528
Establish a perimeter
and stay out of sight.

125
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,706
Wanna drive and I'll hold the gun?

126
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,052
Tell me your name, at least.

127
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,304
Are we best friends now?

128
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,348
You've risked a lot coming here.

129
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,767
We've risked everything, Warden.

130
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:39,778
-No. There was a boy in our path!
-Don't get cute. I have eyes.

131
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:50,956
The tower's that way.

132
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,125
I'm taking a shortcut.
Fewer watchmen this way.

133
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,256
What is that?

134
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,220
Stop.

135
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,518
Stop.

136
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,153
The stories about Salvor Hardin?
They usually begin here.

137
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,531
The warden and the ghost,

138
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,742
inexplicably bound together.

139
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,826
Thanks.

140
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,545
How did they slip past our radar?

141
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,548
Flew in the nap of the earth. Maybe.

142
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,841
Any sign of their ships?

143
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,136
They claimed to be scrappers.
Said they were after a navigation module.

144
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,472
-Obviously bullshit.
-We need to contact the Empire.

145
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,057
We can't do anything
without authorization.

146
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,017
Come on, Mom.
We're an imperial outpost in name only.

147
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,354
When was the last time they even
contacted us? A decade ago?

148
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,564
They won't defend us.
We need to do it ourselves.

149
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,108
Easy. Violence is the last refuge--

150
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,778
Of the incompetent, I know.
That's an old man's doctrine.

151
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,821
It's an observation I made
when I was younger than you.

152
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,158
Would Hari's plan have assumed
we'd wait for help or act on our own?

153
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,328
Hari is not here, Mom.
We need to help ourselves.

154
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,334
Welcome back, best friend.

155
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:21,547
You left the conversation just as we were
really getting to know each other.

156
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,756
Headache?

157
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,716
Teeth feel like they're falling out?

158
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,510
What was that cursed thing?

159
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,595
It was here
when we colonized Terminus.

160
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,266
Didn't show up on any of our scans.
I guess it didn't show up on yours either.

161
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,309
Why did it not affect you?

162
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,980
Let's just say I'm the last person
on Terminus you wanted to come across.

163
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:39,940
So…

164
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,776
what now, Warden?

165
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,655
She had a small army with her.

166
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,949
An-- And their tracks,
some of them were deep.

167
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,494
Shorter stride lengths.
As if they were carrying heavy equipment.

168
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,955
Like they're planning on digging in, Dad.

169
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,708
-Well, what do you wanna do?
-I don't know.

170
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,210
I've been following my instincts, and--

171
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,920
I don't know, maybe it was just dumb luck.

172
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,381
Your instincts didn't just
lead you to the ships.

173
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,633
They led you to her. And you stopped her.

174
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,428
If you were better at math,

175
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:13,015
you'd know that repeated luck was
more than just luck, Salvor.

176
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,851
Whether your mother wants
to admit it or not,

177
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:19,938
we have been following your lead from
the moment you pulled yourself upright.

178
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:24,526
It's no accident
the people made you warden.

179
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,237
So lead us.

180
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,711
I have never had the pleasure, Empire.
How may I be of service?

181
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,046
Captain Obrecht, is it?

182
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,549
Shadowmaster, Empire.
Shadowmaster Obrecht.

183
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,884
A fine likeness.

184
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,640
What's the protocol for dealing
with a problem palace attendant?

185
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,850
What level of attendant,
if I may ask?

186
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,938
-Someone who works in the garden.
-May I ask the nature of the problem?

187
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,482
You may not. I just want her name.

188
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,944
I can ascertain that, Empire.
Along with anything else you may require.

189
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,238
That's all for now.

190
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,541
I saw at least a dozen Anacreons
outside the fence.

191
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,544
Travik, take the southern loop.

192
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,295
Kalin, cover the west.

193
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:29,132
Yate, I want you on the east so you can
spot anyone coming over that ridge.

194
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,970
And if we see any of these guys,
what are we supposed to do?

195
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,054
Nothing.

196
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,140
Don't shoot at them, don't speak to them.
Just watch 'em and keep me informed.

197
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,852
-What's this about Anacreons on Terminus?
-Calls herself Phara.

198
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,396
Beyond that,
nothing about her story adds up.

199
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,815
If anyone can tell
whether somebody's lying, it's you.

200
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,192
That's just the thing.
I can't tell if she's lying

201
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,027
or if she's just not telling the truth.

202
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,279
Is there a difference?

203
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,990
I've got a plan.
But I'm gonna need your help.

204
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,164
What's this? Torture?

205
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,625
He's my manservant.

206
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,087
Runs and fetches.
Reseals my boots when they need it.

207
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:12,509
I'm thinking a watch has passed,
as far as my weald-men are concerned.

208
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,969
Why are you really here, Phara?

209
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,472
Salvor has a talent for reading people.

210
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,101
It's uncanny, really.
I was just telling her mother about it.

211
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,811
She doesn't believe you.

212
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,564
Well, you told her you're my boss.
Now my praise rings hollow.

213
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,191
What's your interest
in the Foundation Tower?

214
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:31,278
The module. I already told you.
You keep asking me the same questions.

215
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,239
I'm giving you a chance
to give better answers.

216
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,657
Crowns.

217
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,288
I know you're after something else.

218
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,626
We don't have any Anacreon artifacts,
no heavy weapons, so what--

219
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,960
This is going in circles.

220
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,421
Explain it to her.

221
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,590
Just give her what she wants.

222
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,759
Your accent's not terrible.

223
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,887
You were taught by someone
in the port city, obviously.

224
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,097
Those lazy vowels.

225
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,599
I'm a trader.

226
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,519
I do business with your people
now and then.

227
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,688
Thought I smelled a whiff
of Thespin on you.

228
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,733
I want the navigation module. That's it.

229
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,984
Another lie.

230
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,861
You speak Anacreon as well?

231
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,029
Not a word.

232
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,697
-Yet you know I'm lying?
-Cats.

233
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,243
That was a 50-50 chance.

234
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,702
Cats again. Who are you really?

235
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,333
Twenty-five percent chance there.

236
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,709
Now it's back to crowns.

237
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,797
Twelve and a half percent.
And another crown. Why are you here?

238
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:33,924
Another crown again.

239
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,483
I'd give you the percentage,
but repeated luck is never luck.

240
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,739
Who are you?

241
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,701
We're scrappers. The module.

242
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,829
You're not scrappers. And the navigation
module's a distraction--

243
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,539
Enough of these child games.

244
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,292
Take this Thespin thug off his leash
and let him get on with it!

245
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,376
Your scars…

246
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,670
keloids.

247
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,051
Your left eye…

248
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,637
nano-glass.

249
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,515
You lose it when
the Empire bombed Anacreon?

250
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,768
I imagine you must have been, what,
five, six at the time?

251
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:31,523
Neutron bombs have a low explosive yield
but a high amount of ionizing radiation.

252
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:35,652
Now, I know about 50% of the population
died off within a week,

253
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,780
another 20 or 30
within the remaining year.

254
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,117
Odds are you came out the other end
an orphan, right?

255
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:47,164
Probably lost a mom and dad.

256
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,125
Boiled alive.

257
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,921
Or maybe s-slower.

258
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:55,714
Cancer.

259
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:02,971
Thyroid for your mother.
Her voice, it changed before she died.

260
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,682
Who else did you lose? A sister?

261
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,897
A brother.

262
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,818
A little brother.

263
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,547
There's a deadness inside her.
It's like a--

264
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,925
It's like a well with no bottom,
just sucking everything in.

265
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,803
She wants to die.

266
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,100
She wants everyone to die. I felt it.

267
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,066
What she said when she broke,
did you understand any of it?

268
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,777
Some, yeah. It's archaic Anacreon,
not the common vernacular.

269
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:02,239
Well, she slipped up.
Because I understood something too.

270
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,577
A name I remember from the holos.
Larken Keaen.

271
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,040
During the Anthor Belt dispute,

272
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,376
Anacreon and Thespis brought gifts
to the Emperor.

273
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,961
My people's was the Book of Ablut--

274
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,338
And Anacreon's was a bow
carved for its greatest hunter.

275
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,632
-Larken Keaen.
-Meaning?

276
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,467
Phara's not just some junker.

277
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,179
She's the Grand Huntress of Anacreon.

278
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,609
All this unrest, who's responsible for it?

279
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,945
Sinkers. A nom de guerre.

280
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:47,993
After the heat sink meltdown on level 77.
It was caused when the Star Bridge fell.

281
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:51,955
And 35 years later we're still grappling
with the aftereffects.

282
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:59,588
The businesses of Empire is
a cascade of competing priorities.

283
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,425
Brother Day will need your support
while I tend to the conclave.

284
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,594
It's overwhelming.

285
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:06,887
For one man.

286
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,516
Fortunately, there are three of us.

287
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,269
Bad tidings also come in threes.
Have you heard the news, Brother?

288
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,941
A communications buoy
in the Arcturus Sector has come off-line.

289
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,985
They must go off-line
all the time, right?

290
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,363
We probably have thousands of them
across the galaxy.

291
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,697
Tens of thousands.

292
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:29,034
But only one that handles communications
in the Outer Reach.

293
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,621
I see that you fail to grasp
the significance.

294
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,748
It's Terminus.

295
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,795
It's where Brother Dusk exiled
Hari Seldon's followers.

296
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:48,262
The Reach. The conclave. Insurgency…

297
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,224
Do you see a pattern forming here?

298
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,226
Show them.

299
00:23:56,103 --> 00:24:00,357
Sensing vulnerability, soon other players
will begin to apply downward pressure.

300
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,696
An exhortation from one of the galaxy's
major religions is a given.

301
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,615
Or perhaps a homegrown insurrection
here on Trantor.

302
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:14,872
If the fall can be accelerated,
can it not also be slowed?

303
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,081
Now look at you, Brother.

304
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:19,585
So smugly self-assured
atop the middle throne.

305
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,004
I used to practice that smile
in the mirror.

306
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,173
Enough. I know how the scene ends.

307
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,049
But have you embraced its lessons?

308
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,136
Luminism.
The Sinker insurrection happening now.

309
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,763
Seldon all but drew you a to-do list.

310
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,016
And you ignored him.

311
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,726
Because he was a charlatan.

312
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,561
You offer nothing new.

313
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:41,023
Just a younger grape…

314
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,733
from the same vine,

315
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,069
destined for the same old bottle.

316
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,238
You can't save yourselves…

317
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,282
but you can save your legacy.

318
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,994
Hari Seldon is long dead.

319
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,456
Murdered by his protégé, no less.

320
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,167
The man was murdered.
But what about the movement, Brother?

321
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,630
Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.

322
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:17,226
Thanks to you, we are now staring down
the barrel of a genuine diplomatic crisis.

323
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,269
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?

324
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,146
Let Phara kill me
and then move on to the kids?

325
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,856
You shouldn't have questioned her
without me.

326
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,608
Be glad I did. We know who she is now.

327
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,693
We have leverage.
We can bargain with her people.

328
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,570
If this choice
inflames the city into violence,

329
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,531
you have achieved
elaborate suicide for us all.

330
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,991
Didn't Hari say
the Foundation survives the first crisis?

331
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,870
Yes, he did. But, as I've told you before,
you are an outlier.

332
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,080
-Meaning?
-Salvor.

333
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,748
Meaning that you weren't accounted for.

334
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,291
You have a connection with the Vault

335
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,627
which couldn't have possibly
have been predicted.

336
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,170
You are not baked into the model.

337
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,713
You're saying I'm not part of God's plan.

338
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,049
I am saying psychohistory
can't account for individuals.

339
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,634
So you're saying
I've destroyed God's plan?

340
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,053
-It's time to take a step back, Salvor.
-Step back?

341
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:55,097
I thought the whole damn point
of the Foundation

342
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,558
was preparing for the unthinkable.

343
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,726
When I asked for more defensive weapons,

344
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,354
you said the likelihood of an attack
seemed remote.

345
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,481
When I wanted to run more drills, nothing.

346
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,859
So here we are now, not prepared.

347
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:11,154
I might be an outlier, but I'm not
the one screwing up the Plan, Lewis.

348
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,414
Lewis Pirenne, director.

349
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:24,418
Now, why would the Anacreon Council
send its highest-ranking military officer

350
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,295
to an imperial outpost?

351
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,964
Is that what you're pretending
your little doomsday cult is?

352
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,883
Because I don't see the Empire anywhere.

353
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,553
All I see are academics, laborers
and very few guns.

354
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,929
You took down the comms buoy.

355
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,558
Of course. We wanted to operate
in private, away from prying eyes.

356
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,728
You have to know the Empire will send
someone to investigate eventually.

357
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:44,855
Or is that the point?

358
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,773
Your women are so much sharper
than your men.

359
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,695
The barbarian kingdoms are exiled.
You have no business here.

360
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,656
"Barbarians."

361
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,951
Just a convenient slur
for anyone not like you.

362
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,122
Trantor left us all here to die.
Your people and mine.

363
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,999
We're just dying at different speeds.

364
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,417
The Foundation isn't dying.

365
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:09,087
We are fulfilling the mission
Hari Seldon entrusted us with.

366
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,841
Seldon also predicted that the fall
would begin at the edge of the galaxy.

367
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,385
-Here.
-The same science

368
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,471
that saved the Imperial Palace
when the Star Bridge fell

369
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,764
protects Terminus City.

370
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,265
You mean your energy barrier?

371
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:25,395
A weapon's only as good as
the man who's wielding it.

372
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,870
Kalin, what's your situation?

373
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,872
It's getting pretty crowded over here.

374
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,208
-I think I need backup.
-Not happening.

375
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,586
Salvor saw a dozen. You're telling me
we've got Anacreons all over?

376
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,506
I'm telling you I'm seeing enough guns
to take out the whole town.

377
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,008
Empire.

378
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,639
The matter we discussed?

379
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,477
Her name is Azura Odili.
A palace botanist since the age of 13.

380
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,523
Her father, deceased, was also
an agroecologist in the gardens.

381
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,277
Her mother founded
a school for the ikebana, now closed.

382
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,196
You said there was a problem?

383
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:21,159
How are problems generally solved
in this situation?

384
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,415
Any manner that achieves its goal.
My job is to eliminate problems, Empire.

385
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,804
Azura Odili.

386
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,684
Oh-dee-lee? Oh-dih-lee?

387
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:46,852
Dee, Empire.

388
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,854
You were outside my chambers earlier.

389
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,066
-Want to know what you think you saw.
-I saw nothing, Empire.

390
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,902
No. I believe you saw something.

391
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,154
I only see what Empire wants me to see.

392
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,489
I could have you removed
from your station,

393
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,743
sent to scrub the heat sinks on level 80.

394
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:06,079
I could do worse to you. Much worse.

395
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,372
You know all this.

396
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,958
Empire, Brother Dusk
has asked me to summon you.

397
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,376
Tell him I'm coming.

398
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,838
Remove this entire bed.

399
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:18,217
From my chambers
the smell of the blossoms is overbearing.

400
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,470
-Empire, you needn't bother with this--
-It's settled. You can go.

401
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,934
Wolvesbreath helps with the pain.

402
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,520
The brownish-green leaves
with the red stripe.

403
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,104
They reduce the swelling and bruising--

404
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,649
I don't recall asking
for your medical advice.

405
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,527
Which?

406
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:00,717
The pointed leaves.

407
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,731
What is it?

408
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,859
Lupi spiritus.

409
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,946
Wolvesbreath, Empire.
From our medicinal garden.

410
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,824
It's an analgesic and vasodilator.

411
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:24,992
Is it poisonous?

412
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:29,329
No. Wolvesbreath is used in tea
as well as tinctures.

413
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:32,708
It stimulates the blood vessels,
promotes healing--

414
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,959
Eat it.

415
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,674
If you're not dead
within the next few hours,

416
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,885
have a kilogram of these
sent to my quarters.

417
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:44,178
Of course, Empire.

418
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,437
Laylo Fulham, get your ass back home
this instant!

419
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,521
Are they gonna get through?

420
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,689
Course not.

421
00:30:56,607 --> 00:31:01,904
Go back to your home, people. Please.
It's not safe out here. Back up. Back up.

422
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,199
You need to come out here. Now.

423
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:06,366
Kind of busy here, Yate.

424
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,993
I know, and I'm still calling.

425
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,246
We've got Anacreon's troops massing
from the east, west, south,

426
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,081
and presumably the north.

427
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,835
Remember how to hold a rifle, old man?

428
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,003
Barrel goes forward?

429
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,465
We've spotted Anacreons
at multiple locations outside the fence.

430
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,842
-I'll go west.
-We'll head north.

431
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,720
I shouldn't leave.
Lewis is completely overmatched in there.

432
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,263
I'll babysit him, I promise.

433
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,307
All right.

434
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,269
Is it true? You got some kind of
Anacreon chieftain in there?

435
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:35,604
You been drinking, Muller?

436
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,857
It's the end of the galaxy, isn't it?
Hari's prediction's coming true.

437
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,360
You got hold of a bad rumor, Muller.
Local poacher's all.

438
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,028
They're already here, aren't they?

439
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,365
Hey, why don't you just
take a break for a second.

440
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,005
Hey!

441
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:03,966
I won't hurt you.

442
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,554
Just tell me who you are.

443
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:10,639
Sal.

444
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,140
Sal.

445
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,726
Sal. Hey, hey. What's wrong?

446
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,770
I was just in the Imperial Library
on Trantor.

447
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,815
-What do you mean you were there?
-I mean I was there. In the stacks.

448
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,609
The ceiling was wooden,
there were all these marble busts.

449
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,278
And there was a boy with a knife.

450
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,073
It was the same boy who
led me to the Anacreons.

451
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:33,453
It's the Vault. I can feel it, Hugo.
It's trying to tell me something

452
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,582
about the Anacreons and this crisis.
Everything.

453
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:40,544
Okay, listen to me. I've always said
you should let this planet shrug you off.

454
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:46,216
But watching you work, where you could
sense what Phara was feeling inside…

455
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:48,927
that's special.

456
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,180
Other people can't do that, Sal.

457
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,890
I have absolute faith in you.

458
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,979
I have absolute faith in you.

459
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,044
Who among you
is Master Statistician Tivole?

460
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:29,134
Empire. May the light never dim.

461
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,761
May the light never dim.

462
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,555
-You received my query.
-I did, Empire.

463
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,807
But I can't say yet we have the results.

464
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,936
How long has it been
since Dusk set you to this task?

465
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,646
Three decades?

466
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:44,900
What do you do
in your mausoleum of calculus

467
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:48,278
if not achieve results?

468
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:53,575
Progress, then. What is your progress?

469
00:33:54,743 --> 00:34:01,041
We believe the-- the predictive models
of Hari Seldon to be counterfactual.

470
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,754
And you believe this why?

471
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:11,342
In the 35 years since Seldon uttered
his heretical proclamations,

472
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,848
the Imperium has expanded, rather than
contracted, by every critical metric--

473
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:16,931
Stop.

474
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,560
Seldon's prophecies.

475
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:24,273
Speak to me of his math,
this "ordinal analysis."

476
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:27,025
It's a spread of fortune teller's cards

477
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:31,071
which Seldon chose
to interpret as divination.

478
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:36,702
The verification he found
in the regression models is unsupported.

479
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:40,581
But what of these-- these recent events?

480
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:41,956
The conclave? Luminism?

481
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,920
Baseless conjecture.
Again, vague and unsupported.

482
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:50,924
I mean, anyone could predict
a return to orthodoxy.

483
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:56,221
Psychohistory is the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination.

484
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,932
If it weren't the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination, what then?

485
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,978
What is the likelihood that it's all true?
Every prophecy?

486
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,981
Vanishingly small, Empire.

487
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,399
But not zero.

488
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:10,986
Correct?

489
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,989
Not zero?

490
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,910
What kind of idiots are you?

491
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:21,163
A thousand imperial mathematicians…

492
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,124
…can't parse the numbers of one man?

493
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:28,670
So there's nothing
anyone in the galaxy can do?

494
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:34,885
Is that what it is?
Is that the best you've got?

495
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,681
Tell me. Tell me!

496
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:44,478
Tell me!

497
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:57,658
In the twilight of a man's life…

498
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,410
…when his biography is nearly complete,

499
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,580
he grows desperate to know
the measure of his days…

500
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:09,169
how his voice compares to
the chorus of those who've come before.

501
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:16,051
Do I matter? Are my choices my own?

502
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:20,597
Or is my destiny governed by
an unseen hand?

503
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,736
Brother Day. Come to see us off?

504
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,614
I was paid a visit by your statisticians.

505
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,617
It's remarkable
how self-reinforcing their results are.

506
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:45,080
I think it's best that you stay
and tend to matters on Trantor.

507
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,543
Empire, a primary Cleon has not left
the bosom of Trantor

508
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,753
since the dawn of the Genetic Dynasty.

509
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:52,838
Demerzel is right.

510
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,508
We have these protocols in place
for a reason.

511
00:36:56,592 --> 00:37:03,182
And I say our protocols have
made us complacent.

512
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,976
When you sat on the middle throne,
as I do now,

513
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,478
and were debating what to do about
Anacreon and Thespis,

514
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:11,773
what our response should be,
do you remember what you said?

515
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,234
I do.

516
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,695
Like it was yesterday.

517
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,530
I was seven.

518
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,700
Our eldest brother had argued
for a bout of grace.

519
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,536
You turned to me and said,
"What do you think, Ascending Dawn?"

520
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,331
I knew you were against grace,

521
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,876
that you wanted to bomb
the barbarian kingdoms.

522
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:35,130
But I was scared. And I dared say so.

523
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,383
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

524
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:45,098
On your watch, the Star Bridge fell.
And from that scar insurgency was birthed.

525
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,601
On your watch, two worlds were incinerated

526
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,229
with not a care to
innocence or consequence.

527
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,732
On your watch, Hari Seldon
and his followers were allowed to flee.

528
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,694
You have bequeathed me
an Empire rent by impulsive action.

529
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:01,698
The same will not be said of me.
Not on my watch.

530
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,701
I would save our legacy.

531
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:05,786
Brother…

532
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,375
you are haunted by
the ghost of a man long dead.

533
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,710
We all are, Brother.

534
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,092
Your watch is over.

535
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:25,889
You will stay on Trantor, tending to
the wounds you have allowed to fester.

536
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,141
Go.

537
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,520
Return Brother Dusk's belongings
to the palace.

538
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:46,660
Certainly now the Empire will
no longer be rent by impulsive action.

539
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:19,985
You summoned me, Empire?

540
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:22,779
A communications buoy has gone dark
in the Outer Reach.

541
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,574
Take your team and investigate.

542
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,618
At once, Empire.

543
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,119
Dorwin.

544
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,706
Our dispatches from the Foundation
have become sporadic.

545
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:33,874
Pay them a visit.

546
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:37,836
And remind the Foundation
that Empire will not be kept in the dark.

547
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,236
-Is that, uh--
-Doesn't look good, does it?

548
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,134
Who is in charge here, Lewis? You?
Or is it the Warden with the coin tricks?

549
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,553
Because it seems
she's managed to complicate matters.

550
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,972
-Let me be clear, Huntress Keaen--
-Grand Huntress.

551
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:13,599
The only reason we have a crisis

552
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:17,144
is because you trespassed
on the Emperor's personal domain.

553
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,439
If only Salvor had taken me to the tower
and given me what I'd wanted,

554
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,149
we'd already be off-planet.

555
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,734
The module from our slow ship?

556
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:26,320
It's not as if
your people have any use for it.

557
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,407
You're marooned on Terminus.
The Empire made sure of that.

558
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,825
Lewis.

559
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:33,744
Why do you need it?

560
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:36,455
My people are technologically bankrupt.

561
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,165
We're dying, Director.

562
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:42,461
We have been ever since the Empire
set our atmosphere on fire.

563
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:46,381
Half our population lost
for a crime that we were innocent of.

564
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,300
Unlike you, we have ships.

565
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,970
We can leave our poisoned world,
find another star system.

566
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:55,224
If only we had
the means to navigate the void.

567
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:57,017
The Empire would crush us
for assisting you.

568
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,852
We're forcing your hand, Director.

569
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,730
Because we have nothing left to lose.

570
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,901
You can't play chess with someone
who's willing to set the board on fire.

571
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,949
Is that some kind of flak cannon?

572
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,618
Wasting their time if they think
that's gonna penetrate the fence.

573
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:18,163
None of this feels right.
Phara is smarter than this.

574
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,666
They took out the comms buoy,
and they came in prepared.

575
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,418
There's a larger strategy here,
and I am missing it somehow.

576
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:25,754
What if I take my ship,
make a run for the stars, get help?

577
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,216
No, no. They'd shoot you out of the sky
before you ever made it into orbit.

578
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,010
Regretting you didn't bug out
when you had the chance?

579
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,763
Done a lot of foolish things in my life,
Salvor Hardin.

580
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,682
Sticking by your side is not one of them.

581
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,434
Best manservant ever.

582
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:52,281
The Vault isn't Anacreon…

583
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,199
or alien at all.

584
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:55,742
It's gotta be connected to Hari.

585
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:56,827
How do you know that?

586
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,787
Because the vision I saw
when I blacked out,

587
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:04,042
it was on Trantor in Hari's library,
with a boy holding a knife on me.

588
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,503
What if it was a warning to stay away?

589
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,256
What if Lewis is right?

590
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,467
I'm an outlier, just like he says,
barging around, knocking things over,

591
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,844
screwing up Seldon's plan?

592
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,430
Salvor, what if you are Seldon's plan?

593
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:22,394
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

594
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:26,857
Remember my promise, Warden?
Razing your city to the ground?

595
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,901
But the movements of masses,

596
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,529
the rise and falls of cultures,
causes and worlds…

597
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:36,533
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

598
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:38,493
It's time.

599
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:42,372
And the beginning of the end,
as befitting its name,

600
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,249
took place on Terminus.
