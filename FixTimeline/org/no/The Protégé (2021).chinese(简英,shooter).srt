00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,840
你吗?肯定是女巫。
You? Definitely a witch.

大部分时间都和普鲁斯特在一起。

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,360
才三个星期，你就只带回来这些?
Three weeks, and this is all you come back with?

81
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,870
啊，你知道卖家，他们知道你大老远跑来，所以他们就装出难到手的样子。
Ah, you know sellers, they know you've come all that way, and they play hard to get.

你以为你在干什么?

有一天，他跟我说"70岁是新的30岁"
So, the other day, he says to me "70 is the new 30."

00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,670
那只是老家伙说的话。
Well, that's just something old guys say.

86
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,000
他的协议做得怎么样了?他遵照医嘱了吗?
How is he doing with his protocol? Is he following the doctor's orders?

87
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,310
更像是听从自己的命令。
More like, following his own orders.

88
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,280
生日快乐。。。再也没有他妈的生日了。

00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:30,960
它是木头。

非洲榄仁树。

108
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,440
我都快放弃寻找的希望了。
I was just about giving up hope on finding one.

109
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,450
你到底是怎么……
How in the world did you…

110
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,620
你。
You.

111
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:47,472
你教我如何找到不想被发现的东西。
You taught me how to find things that didn't wanna be found.

阿尔伯特·金(Albert King)就是其中之一。

不!
No!

116
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,780
你要哭了，是吧?
You're gonna cry now, aren't you?

117
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,800
那只是因为我不能按照它应该的方式来玩。
Only because I can't play it the way it needs to be played.

118
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,020

不，是曼彻斯特的黛西。

黛西在多佛是一条堤坝。

拥有一个足够信任你的朋友是一件难得的礼物，在你请求之前，他不会试图帮助你。
It is a rare gift to have a friend who trusts you enough not to try and help until you ask.

124
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:58,900
如果你和那些人一起掉到池塘里，你会淹死的。
If you fell in the pond with those you'd drown.

125
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:02,020
好吧，如果我掉到池塘里没有它们，我可能会飘走。
Well, if I fell in a pond without them I would probably float away.

126
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
嗨,亲爱的。小心你的手指。

128
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,240
她还是个婴儿，什么都不懂。

129
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:19,885
在那里。

00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:27,699
你有自己的秘密藏身之处。
You have your own secret hideout.

131
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:30,883
为什么我一点都不惊讶?
Why am I not surprised?

132
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,640
我买下了这栋楼。
I bought the building.

133
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,120
——什么?——书店。
- What? - The bookstore.

134
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,960
这是你的。自由和明确的。
It's yours. Free and clear.

135
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:45,870
你没必要这么做。
You didn't have to do that.

136
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,560
我知道，但这是你的激情所在。
I know, but it's your passion.

137
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,800
而且，我很高兴知道我不在的时候你还有工作要做。
And, it makes me feel good to know you'll have something to work on while I'm gone.

138
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,280
那是什么?
What is that?

139
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:04,560
那些是在另一边等着我的灵魂。
Those are the souls waiting for me on the other side.

140
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,823
我相信他们已经计划好了一个招待会。
I'm sure they have a reception planned.

141
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:10,250
啊，提前送走了这么多人。
Ah… sent away so many prematurely.

142
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,850
要么通过我的手，要么通过你。
Either by my hand or through you.

143
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,110
我们从来没有送走过没有来由的人。
We never sent anyone away who didn't have it coming.

144
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,211
也许吧。
Maybe.

145
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:23,290
但是，我敢肯定有不少鬼魂在那儿等着我挑骨头呢。
But… I'm sure there are quite a few spirits up there waiting for me with a bone to pick.

146
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,710
你真的相信你会上天吗?
You really believe you're going up?

147
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,937
你不?
Don't you?

148
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,080
卢卡斯海耶斯。
Lucas Hayes.

149
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,840
我需要我们的朋友帮我找到他。
I need our friend to find him for me.

我们的过去再也回不去了，小变色龙。

要么是，要么不是。

书不像木桩，你买不到五分熟的。
Books aren't like stake, you can't get them like medium rare.

- It's funny. - Sarcastic.

181
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,750
是的,但是有趣。

——对不起。-你没有?

190
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:41,480
看来我运气不太好。
Well, looks like I'm out of luck.

191
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,623
好吧。你觉得呢?也许诗歌?

192
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,580

塔穆雷和其他诗歌,这首我不知道。
TAMERLANE AND OTHER POEMS I don't... I don't know this one.

实际上是埃德加·爱伦·坡。

她的手腕很精致，好主意。
She does have exquisite wrists, good idea.

203
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,916
还有别的吗?
Is there something else?

00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,360
我觉得你很有趣。
I find you interesting.

205
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,360
-你是说…——你很有趣。

漂亮，当然，不是那种装饰性的。

27分钟。
Twenty seven minutes.

211
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,350

首先我得假装取消约会，然后我得喂我的猫。

290
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,551
在我办公室，一小时后。
My office, one hour.

291
00:38:58,758 --> 00:38:59,750
就我们俩?
We'll be alone?

292
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:01,870
我的律师会到场。
My lawyer will be present.

293
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,923
是站在你身后倒威士忌的人吗?
That would be the man standing behind you pouring a scotch?

294
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:48,111
很高兴见你,小姐。
Delighted, Miss.

295
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:50,150
非常准时。
Exactly on time.

296
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:01,801
请坐。
Please.

297
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,489
杜凯先生，我的私人律师。
Monsieur Duquet, my personal attorney.

298
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,610
要来点香槟吗?——爱德华·亚瑟·海耶斯
- Would you like some champagne? - Edward Arthur Hayes.

299
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,370
埃迪和我一起参与了一个铝土矿开采项目直到他出事。
Eddie and I were involved in a bauxite mining project together until his accident.

300
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,160
那不是意外，那是暗杀。
It wasn't an accident, it was an assassination.

301
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:27,630
我们是有用的。
We were useful.

302
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:32,100
这个国家具有可塑性，适合某些商业行为。
The country was malleable, ripe for certain business practices.

303
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:35,150
埃迪在玩弄一大堆精致的盘子。
Eddie was juggling a lot of delicate plates.

304
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:39,751
你怎么会对一个死了快三十年的人感兴趣?
What's your interest in a man who's been dead almost thirty years?

305
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:41,991
我对他儿子感兴趣。
I'm interested in his son.

306
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:43,991
卢卡斯海耶斯。
Lucas Hayes.

307
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,150
我很抱歉?
I'm sorry?

308
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:47,580
有三个人因为打听他的下落而死了。
Three people are dead because they inquired about him.

309
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:50,110
他杀了他们，我要去找他。
He had them killed and I'm going to find him.

310
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,710
我应该和他谈谈吗?
Should I be talking to him?

311
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:58,271
我和卢卡斯·海耶斯一点关系都没有。
I have no connection with Lucas Hayes.

312
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:01,220
这跟我有什么关系?
And what does any of this got to do with me?

313
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,040
我也在想这件事。
I was wondering the same thing.

314
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:07,763
沃尔先生过去的关系与任何人无关。
Mr. Vohl's past relationships are no one's concern.

315
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,923
当然也和你无关。
And certainly none of yours.

316
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,413
哦，我已经让他们与我有关了。
Oh, I've made them my concern.

317
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,183
太糟糕了。
Too bad.

318
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:38,870
我需要知道一切。
I need to know everything.

319
00:41:39,973 --> 00:41:40,990
你是谁?
Who are you?

320
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,270
谁雇了你?
Who hired you?

321
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,685
为什么对卢卡斯·海耶斯感兴趣?
Why the interest in Lucas Hayes?

322
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,800
如果你愿意，我们可以换一种方式。
We can do this another way if you'd like.

323
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:12,400
他妈的放开我!
Fucking let me go!

324
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,478
去那里。
Get up there.

325
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,967
给我一把枪。
Hand me a gun.

326
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,863
喷水阀
SPRINKLER VALVE

327
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:51,830
你他妈以为你要去哪?
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

328
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,293
说出来。
Say it.

329
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:20,110
——去你妈的!——说它!
- Fuck you! - Say it!

330
00:43:53,165 --> 00:43:54,160
她在那儿!
She's down there!

331
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,165
让我们从你的名字开始。
Let's start with your name.

332
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,232
为什么穆迪在找爱德华·海斯的儿子?
Why was Moody looking for Edward Hayes' son?

333
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:19,191
还有谁我们应该知道?
Who else out there should we know about?

334
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,064
他妈的!
Fuck!

335
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:18,310
有人能坚持这么久吗。
Anyone ever last this long.

336
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:20,870
反正现在也由不得我们了。
It's out of our hands now, anyway.

337
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,760
他吗?
Him?

338
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,431
那是漫长的27分钟。
That was a long 27 minutes.

339
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,110
我还在等你的电话。
I'm still waiting for your call.

340
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,241
没关系。
It's all right.

341
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,099
我不认为这些是针对我个人的。
I don't take these things personally.

342
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:46,750
骨头汤。
Bone broth.

343
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:50,630
有助于缓解炎症和瘀伤。
Helps with inflammation and bruising.

344
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,660
来。
Here.

345
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:55,900
小心。烫。小心。
Careful. It's hot. Watch it.

346
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:58,156
给。
There you go.

347
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,723
我自己就喜欢这个。
I like this myself.

348
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:05,554
给你，小口。
Here you go, small sips.

349
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,013
好吗?
Good?

350
00:47:11,951 --> 00:47:17,337
我不想骗你，你不可能有好结果的。
Not gonna lie to you, there's not much of a chance this ends well for you.

351
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:20,391
外面那个家伙。
That guy out there.

352
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,449
我们为同一个人工作。
We work for the same individual.

353
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:25,350
老板有麻烦了。他打电话给他，让他处理。
Boss has a problem. He calls him, he takes care of it.

354
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:30,072
按我的口味，这有点强硬，但这不是我的决定。
Little heavy handed for my taste but that's not my call.

355
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:34,110
你朋友穆迪的事我很遗憾。
I'm sorry about your friend, Moody.

356
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,232
我没有参与其中。
I had no part in that.

357
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:41,191
或者书店的火灾。
Or the fire fight at the bookstore.

358
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,028
我是个事后诸葛明的人。
I'm an after-the-facts guy.

359
00:47:43,253 --> 00:47:45,630
我来是为了确保没有后患。
I come in to make sure there's no loose ends.

360
00:47:45,951 --> 00:47:48,631
我寻找那些看似无害，实则不然的东西。
I look for things that might seem benign, but aren't.

361
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:52,831
就像一个杀手开的书店，孩子，我从没想到会有这样的事发生。
Like a bookstore run by an assassin, boy, I never saw that one coming.

362
00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:55,390
我完全误解你了。
I misread you completely.

363
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,329
我可以帮你离开这里。
I can help you out of here.

364
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,420
好吧?
Okay?

365
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:05,490
但你得帮我。
But you have to help me.

366
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,071
我是你最后的防线。
I'm your last line of defense.

367
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:11,990
路到尽头，没有更多的生命线。
End of the road, no more lifelines.

368
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:16,151
你明白吗?
You understand?

369
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,697
好吧。
All right.

370
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:25,270
你忘记把骨头漂白了。
You forgot to blanch the bones.

371
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:28,890
你的汤。
Your soup.

372
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:33,751
你在烤骨头之前必须先把它焯一下。
You have to blanch the bones before you roast them.

373
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,311
锁住矿物质，对治疗更有好处。
Locks the minerals in, it's better for healing.

374
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:54,290
你从她嘴里问出什么了吗?
You got anything out of her?

375
00:48:54,388 --> 00:48:55,510
是的,没有。
Yes and no.

376
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,022
那他妈是什么意思?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

377
00:48:58,129 --> 00:49:00,240
意思是我明早会回来跟进她的情况。
Means I'll be back in the morning to follow up with her.

378
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,397
-我不需要你，伦勃朗。——嗯…
- I don't need you here, Rembrandt. - Well…

379
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:04,501
签支票的人却有不同的想法。
The man who signs the checks thought differently.

380
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,794
-哦,是吗?-是的。
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

381
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:06,970
为什么呢?
And why is that?

382
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,689
哦，我不知道。
Oh, I don't know.

383
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,330
也许是因为你没征得沃尔的同意就杀了他。
Maybe it's because you killed Vohl without asking his permission.

384
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,710
沃尔什么都知道，他跟我们有直接联系。
Vohl knew everything, he was a direct connection.

385
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:15,300
就会像帐篷一样折起来。
Would've folded like a tent.

386
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:19,911
你……是的，杀了我，你们都是一样的:先开枪再问问题。
You… yes, kill me, you're all the same: shoot first and ask questions later.

387
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,337
推迟那些强化审讯技巧。
And hold off on those enhanced interrogation techniques.

388
00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:25,340
我希望她早上头脑清醒。
I want her clear-headed in the morning.

389
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,591
他明天就会把她击垮。
He'll break her tomorrow.

390
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,580
也许他已经把她击垮了。
Maybe he broke her already.

391
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:38,140
那老人非常想知道她知道些什么。
The old man is desperate to know what she knows.

392
00:49:40,786 --> 00:49:44,715
我想知道如果他的"神奇小子"在发现之前杀了她会是什么感觉。
I wonder how it'd feel if his boy wonder ends up killing her before he finds out.

393
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:49,062
我猜他会去找一个新的神童。
I'm guessing he'll look for a new boy wonder.

394
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,780
就在我们开始了解对方的时候。
Just when we were getting to know each other.

395
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:50,290
我在机场，船厂和火车站都派了人。
I've got teams at the airport, shipyard and train station.

396
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,900
她不会跑的，她会舔自己的伤口。
She's not gonna run, she's gonna lick her wounds.

397
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,403
然后她就会来找你
Then she's coming after you.

398
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:55,670
好。
Good.

399
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,725
真的吗?
Really?

400
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:02,350
因为现在是4:0。她是取胜。
Cause right now it's 4:0. She's wining.

401
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,114
你在哪里买西装?
Where do you buy your suits?

402
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,670
因为我有个跟他一样高大的堂兄，他很不容易相处。
Cause I've got a cousin as big and tall and he's a hard time.

403
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:19,751
没有人的家。
Nobody's home.

404
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,967
我可以带你去边境。
Well, I can get you to the border.

405
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:28,111
伦敦现在对你来说可能不安全。
London may not be safe for you right now.

406
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:36,631
这是越南，安娜，你知道这里是什么样子的。
This is Vietnam, Anna, you know what's it like here.

407
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:39,031
你活着是欠穆迪的。
You owe it to Moody to stay alive.

408
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:42,751
我知道我欠他什么。
I know what I owe him.

409
00:52:55,017 --> 00:52:55,958
走了。
Go.

410
00:52:58,415 --> 00:52:59,980
你他妈以为我给你钱…
The fuck you think I gave you the money of...

411
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:13,390
到此为止，孩子。
End of the line, kid.

412
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,272
走!
Get in!

413
00:53:30,068 --> 00:53:31,190
小心!
Watch out!

414
00:53:32,471 --> 00:53:37,671
穆迪有他特有的美丽。
Moody was beautiful, in his way.

415
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:40,160
他是善良的。
He was kind.

416
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:44,231
不是通过努力，这就是他的一部分。
And not through effort, it was just a part of who he was.

417
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:48,790
他没有救我的命，他给了我一条命。
He didn't save my life, he gave me a life.

418
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:55,097
他知道我是谁，我变成了什么。
He knew who I was, what I've become.

419
00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:57,546
他保护了我。
And he protected me.

420
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:08,590
海耶斯已经死了三十年了，沃尔死了更久。
Hayes has been dead for thirty years, Vohl was gone longer.

421
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:12,020
有一群坏人在找你。
You've got some very bad people looking for you.

422
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:15,531
卢卡斯·海耶斯杀了穆迪，他知道我在找他。
Lucas Hayes killed Moody, he knows I'm looking for him.

423
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:18,310
他最后的已知地点是圣奎特里亚医院。
His last known location is St. Quiteria Hospital.

424
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,367
最聋的莫过于不愿倾听的人。
Nobody is as deaf as those who don't wanna listen.

425
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,431
你好,阮女士。
Hello, Ms. Nguyen.

426
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,260
卫生部已经有一段时间没有来我们这儿了。
It's been some time since we've had a visit from the Ministry of Health.

427
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:41,060
要那么久远的记录…
And to request records from that far back…

428
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,196
是的,我知道。
Yes, I know.

429
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:47,958
我们希望能从中找到一些东西来帮助我们排除环境因素，因为我们正在进行一项研究。
We're hoping to find something in there that will help us rule out environmental factors, cause we are in the midst of a study.

430
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,830
谢谢你！
Thank you.

431
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:51,750
卢卡斯·海耶斯，早在我来这里之前。
Lucas Hayes, well before my time here.

432
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,360
2585024586.
2585024586.

433
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,620
收到，我让医生去查。
Copy, I'll get Doc on it.

434
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,712
好吧。
Okay.

435
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,223
医生来了，调出了他的记录。
Doc came through, pulled his records.

436
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:23,683
然后呢?
And?

437
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:32,390
坐下，卢卡斯·海斯于1999年6月2日被录取到圣基特里亚，根据他的记录，他从未离开过。
Sit down: Lucas Hayes was admitted to St. Quiteria on 2nd June, 1999, and according to his records never left.

438
00:56:33,729 --> 00:56:37,310
抱歉，看来这孩子以克里斯蒂安的名字重新入院了。
I apologize, seems the boy was re-admitted under the name Christian.

439
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:39,580
克里斯蒂安，对，是他母亲的娘家姓。
Christian, right, his mother's maiden name.

440
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:43,497
我到的时候他已经在这里了，已经当了二十多年的病人了。
He was already here when I arrived, been a patient for more than twenty years.

441
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,942
他不喜欢别人碰他。
He doesn't like to be touched.

442
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,390
他不能说话。又聋又瞎。
He can't speak. Also deaf and blind.

443
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,274
他这样有多久了?
And how long has he been like this?

444
00:56:56,628 --> 00:57:00,110
他六岁时被确诊，我相信，病情迅速恶化。
He was diagnosed when he was six, I believe, it regressed rapidly.

445
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,631
他能活这么久真是个奇迹。
It's a miracle he's lived as long.

446
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:04,871
谁来支付他的医疗费用?
And who pays for his care?

447
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,554
我们有一笔慷慨的捐赠。
We have a generous endowment.

448
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,190
这里的每个人都免费治疗。
Everyone here is treated for free.

449
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:18,560
哇!四个人死了，没有录像。
Wow! Four men dead, nothing on camera.

450
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,191
这地方看起来像个屠宰场。
Place looks like an abattoir.

451
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:21,310
是因为食物吗?
Was it the food?

452
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,215
你知道，虐待是不礼貌的。
You know, it was bad manners.

453
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:25,040
是啊，你不能这样对待一位女士。
Yeah, well, that's no way to treat a lady.

454
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,381
我不是淑女。
I'm no lady.

455
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,263
倒不是说我自己是个绅士。
Not that I was a gentleman myself.

456
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:30,003
我不会看轻你的。
I wouldn't sell yourself short.

457
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,476
来自你，这是一种赞美。
Coming from you, that's a compliment.

458
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:36,711
我正忙着呢…圣基特里亚的好姐妹们还好吗?
I'm in the middle of something... Hey, how were good sisters of the St. Quiteria?

459
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,760
好到让我知道我找错人了。
Good enough to let me know I've been looking for the wrong person.

460
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:45,230
好姑娘们。
Good gals out there.

461
00:57:45,523 --> 00:57:47,243
圣基特里亚，你知道她是谁吗?
St. Quiteria, do you know who she was?

462
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,870
十五岁时，她领导了一场对抗罗马军团的游击战。
Fifteen years old, she led a guerrilla war against the Roman legions.

463
00:57:51,544 --> 00:57:52,129
混蛋。
Bad ass.

464
00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:54,290
他们砍下她的头，把剩下的喂狗。
They chopped off her head and fed the rest to the dogs.

465
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:55,900
同样,不礼貌。
Again, bad manners.

466
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:57,090
嘿，要一起吃晚饭吗?
Hey, you up for a dinner?

467
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,740
我可以回答几个问题，帮你省点时间。
I could answer some questions and save you some time.

468
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:02,591
我们说La Cinq怎么样?明天晚上，八点钟。
What do say if we say La Cinq? Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.

469
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,897
我是说你可以这么说。但我不会去的。
I mean you can say it. But I won't be there.

470
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,430
我会告诉你时间和地点。
I'll give you the time and place.

471
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:12,151
你对她很感兴趣。
You're intrigued by her.

472
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:14,990
好奇。
Curious.

473
00:58:15,432 --> 00:58:16,491
我需要担心吗?
Need I worry?

474
00:58:24,278 --> 00:58:27,470
晚宴名单，先生，200名宾客，都经过审核。
The gala list, sir, 200 guests, all vetted.

475
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:33,350
满屋子的富人和特权人士都在为崇高的事业捐赠大笔款项。
The joys of a room full of the wealthy and the privileged donating large sums for a noble cause.

476
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,820
快乐不会老。
Never gets old.

477
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:37,961
好。
Good.

478
00:58:43,512 --> 00:58:44,773
你为什么要这么做?
Why did you do this?

479
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:48,063
处在我这个位置的人就该这么做，迈克尔。
It's what people in my position are supposed to do, Michael.

480
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,205
给予不幸的人。
Give to the less fortunate.

481
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:52,605
我问我是否应该担心。
I asked if I should be worried.

482
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:54,742
关于那个女人。
About the woman.

483
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,828
不。不用。
Nope. Not yet.

484
00:58:58,031 --> 00:59:01,351
请在星期天之前把这件不愉快的事做完。
Please wrap up this unpleasantness by Sunday.

485
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,864
我不想在庆典前尴尬。
I don't wanna be embarrassed before the celebration.

486
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:24,963
哇。
Wow.

487
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:29,400
谢谢你,本。
Thank you, Ben.

488
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:34,430
这里的人都认识我。
They know me here.

489
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:35,992
干杯。
Cheers.

490
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,958
有人杀了我的一个朋友就因为他几年前完成的一份合同。
Someone killed a friend of mine because of a contract he completed years ago.

491
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,377
我问起这件事的人最后都死了。
And anyone I ask about it ends up dead.

492
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,380
这是为什么呢?
Why is that?

493
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,143
我不知道，但有些人可能会把它当成一种征兆。
I don't know, but some people might take it as a sign.

494
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,474
你为什么不把它当成一个未解之谜呢?
Why don't you just consider it a mystery best left unsolved?

495
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,080
但我喜欢推理小说。
But I like mysteries.

496
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:55,110
当我开始做这个的时候，我还是个怪人。
When I started this I was curios.

497
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,710
然后我从好奇变成了关心。
And then I went from curious to concerned.

498
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,500
现在呢?
And now?

499
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,951
我很暴躁。
I'm testy.

500
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:02,951
相信我，我暴躁的时候你是不会想认识我的。
An trust me, you don't wanna know me when I'm testy.

501
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,111
香港9毫米。
HK 9mm.

502
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:10,463
很好。
Very good.

503
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,090
从我的角度看不是。
Not from where I'm sitting.

504
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:16,190
谁在为那个孤儿买单?我想跟那个人谈谈。
Who's paying for the orphan kid? I'd like to talk to whoever that is.

505
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:17,240
那是不明智的。
That'd be unwise.

506
01:00:17,311 --> 01:00:20,471
不智在杀一个曾是我父亲的人。
Unwise is killing a man who was a second father to me.

507
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,303
我们已经不明智了。
We are way past unwise.

508
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:24,230
这地方真不适合打人。
This is a really bad place for a hit.

509
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,463
高档餐厅，每个出口都有保安，更别提摄像头了。
High-end restaurant, the security at every exit, not to mention the cameras.

510
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:30,950
你知道吗，你已经知道了。
You know what, you already knew that.

511
01:00:31,123 --> 01:00:32,544
我不是来杀你的…
Oh, I'm not here to kill you…

512
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:36,151
然而。只是为了得到答案。
Yet. Just to get answers.

513
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,790
你总是这样问吗?
You always ask like this?

514
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,340
是啊，我说话的时候喜欢引起别人的注意?
Yeah, I like to have peoples' attention when I talk, you know?

515
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:41,471
嗯…
Well…

516
01:00:41,657 --> 01:00:45,226
你确实引起了下面那些男孩的注意。
you certainly have the attention of the boys down there.

517
01:00:46,297 --> 01:00:49,140
听着，你至少射三颗子弹才能确保我死了。
Look, you're gonna have to put at least three in me to be sure.

518
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:50,031
四颗。
Four.

519
01:00:50,191 --> 01:00:52,730
很好。给你留5颗。以防有什么麻烦。
Fine. That leaves you with five. In case there's trouble.

520
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:54,710
你觉得这就能让你离开这里吗?
You think that's enough to get you out of here?

521
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,929
四次快速射击，然后在混乱中慢慢走向出口。是的。
Four quick shots and then the slow walk to the exit amongst the chaos. Yeah.

522
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,690
可能会发生意想不到的事情。
Something unexpected could happen.

523
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,089
你知道，通常是这样的。
You know, it usually does.

524
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,140
SIG 226，后座力很猛。
SIG 226, it's got that great kick.

525
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,440
是的。
Yeah.

526
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:19,650
你觉得怎么样。我们第一次尴尬的沉默。
How about that. Our first awkward silence.

527
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:23,743
知道吗，我还不知道你叫什么。
You know what, I didn't get your name.

528
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:24,661
安娜。
Anna.

529
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:26,224
—荣幸。——我们将会看到。
- Pleasure. - We'll see.

530
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,150
我们还是忘了这些把戏吧。
What do you say we forget these tricks.

531
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,431
我们去找个好点的酒店吧。
Let's just go for a nice hotel.

532
01:01:34,556 --> 01:01:37,270
你拿枪指着我的阴部然后叫我上床?
You point a gun at my pussy and then you ask me to bed?

533
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,695
我喜欢你的风格。
I like your style.

534
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,343
那个拿空心枪指着我蛋蛋的女人说。
Said the woman with hollow-points pointed at my balls.

535
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,695
希望这不会弄得一团糟。这是我最喜欢的鞋子。
Well, let's hope this doesn't get messy. These are my favorite shoes.

536
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,151
马诺洛，经典的四英寸高跟鞋。
Manolo's, classic four inch pumps.

537
01:01:48,419 --> 01:01:51,870
一个了解坡和鞋类的人。
A man who knows Poe and footwear.

538
01:01:55,231 --> 01:02:00,271
让我委婉地告诉你，你再这样下去，你会死的。
Let me put this to you delicately, you keep this up, you're gonna die.

539
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,031
越南一直是一个死亡之地。
Vietnam has always been a place of death.

540
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,163
只有幸运的人才能活着出来。我曾经很幸运。
Only lucky ones make it out alive. I was lucky once.

541
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,583
幸运不会有两次。
You don't get lucky twice.

542
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,979
我要找出杀害我朋友的凶手。
I'm going to find out who killed my friend.

543
01:02:11,215 --> 01:02:12,303
然后呢?
And when you do?

544
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:16,230
我要结束他们的生命，还有任何阻碍我的人。
I'm going to end their life, and anyone standing in my way.

545
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:21,510
谢谢你让我度过了一个愉快的夜晚。
Thank you for a lovely evening.

546
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:31,510
我知道这听起来很疯狂，但我真的很想再见到你，换个环境。
Hey, I know it sounds crazy, but I'd really like to see you again under, you know, different circumstances.

547
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,310
这是私人时间。
This was personal time.

548
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:37,191
所以这是你见过的最好的环境。
So these are the best circumstances you'll ever see me in.

549
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,240
说话。
Speak.

550
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:25,230
搞定后给我打电话。
Call me when it's done.

551
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:34,623
我以为你去追查腐败的会计师了。
I thought you're off chasing corrupt accountants.

552
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,103
我找到了一个酒店房间里面有她的东西，包括她的护照。
I found a hotel room with all of her shit, including her passport.

553
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,030
名字叫娜迪娅可娃。
Name's Nadia Zhukova.

554
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,231
亚裔俄国人。
An Asian Russian.

555
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:43,930
男孩。
Boy.

556
01:03:44,231 --> 01:03:46,745
你从来没有真正看到过。
You don't really see that ever.

557
01:03:47,831 --> 01:03:50,287
干得好，你一定累坏了吧?
Good work, you must be exhausted, huh?

558
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,390
看来我晚了一天。
Looks like I'm a day late.

559
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:11,221
还差一美元。恐怕没吃多少。
And a dollar short. Didn't take much I'm afraid.

560
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:12,711
他唱得像只小鸟，不是吗?
He sang like a bird, didn't he?

561
01:07:12,857 --> 01:07:14,810
我现在知道的所有事情。
All of the things I know now.

562
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:18,190
我知道你的上司是谁，就是批准杀害穆迪的人。
I know who your boss is, the man who sanctioned Moody's killing.

563
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:22,071
他是一条大鱼。
He's a big fish.

564
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:23,950
你勾引他的时候更有趣。
More fun when you hook him.

565
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:25,550
那我想…
Well, then I guess…

566
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:28,991
我想我们很快就能见面了。
I guess we'll be seeing each other real soon then.

567
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,750
比你想象的要快。
Sooner than you think.

568
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,967
你的手怎么了?
Hey, what happened to your hand?

569
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,791
下定决心:
Make up your mind:

570
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:35,140
杀我还是操我?
Kill me or fuck me?

571
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:49,600
真奇怪，我们在这家伙的床上，而他…
It's so weird that we're in this guy's bed while he's…

572
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:51,791
放上去。
up there.

573
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,111
你知道,上吊。
You know, hanging.

574
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,019
不。
No.

575
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,984
那就浪费了一张好床。
Would be a waste of a nice bed.

576
01:10:00,871 --> 01:10:01,711
好吧。
Okay.

577
01:10:06,156 --> 01:10:07,690
你干这行多久了?
How long have you been doing this?

578
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:10,170
不是，你知道，这个，但是…
Not, you know, this, but…

579
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:11,670
长到不会错过。
Long enough not to miss.

580
01:10:12,871 --> 01:10:13,911
你很幸运。
You got lucky.

581
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:16,502
不。
Nah.

582
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,431
你不想让我死。
You don't want me dead.

583
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:20,480
然而。
Yet.

584
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:23,071
你为什么不杀了我?
Why haven't you killed me?

585
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:25,074
你能吗?
Could you?

586
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:31,326
我可以在你后脑勺上放两颗然后去做三明治。
I could put two in the back of your head and go make a sandwich.

587
01:10:33,951 --> 01:10:34,751
好。
Well.

588
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,409
你总是说这不会成功的。
You always said this wasn't gonna work out.

589
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:41,314
不。
No.

590
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,970
这是我的经验，从来没有。
It's been my experience, it never does.

591
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:45,550
至少对另一个人来说不是。
At least not for the other guy.

592
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:47,970
有办法解决吗?
Have a way around that?

593
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,751
你掌握了所有的主动权。
You are holding all the cards.

594
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:57,840
我在看一个女人在大风中踩着绷紧的绳子从鲨鱼池上走过。
I'm watching a woman who walk over a shark tank on a tight rope in high winds.

595
01:10:59,516 --> 01:11:01,344
你撑不过去的，安娜。
You're not gonna make it, Anna.

596
01:11:02,369 --> 01:11:03,710
他是个坏人。
He's a bad man.

597
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,951
做了坏事的人。
Who's done very bad things.

598
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:52,871
你就这么躺着吗?
So, you just gonna lay there?

599
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,038
很高兴见到你，孩子。
Good to see you, kid.

600
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:09,352
进去。出去。
Get in. Get out.

601
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:12,630
你知道运气只有一次。
You know you only get lucky once.

602
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,900
是的。刚才有人告诉我的。
Yeah. Someone else just told me that.

603
01:12:15,013 --> 01:12:15,790
好吧。
Okay.

604
01:12:18,154 --> 01:12:19,251
上帝!
God!

605
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:22,110
-只是一点胶水。只是一点胶水。-你怎么回事!
- Just a little glue. Just a little glue. - What's wrong with you!

606
01:12:22,224 --> 01:12:23,870
没事的，咬紧牙关。
It's okay, grit your teeth.

607
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,020
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

608
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:28,671
我还是为克劳迪娅的事感到难过。
You know, I still feel really bad about Claudia.

609
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:32,711
她根本不会做饭，但她不应该那样死。
She couldn't cook worth a shit, but she didn't deserve to die like that.

610
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,140
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

611
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,083
好吧。
Okay.

612
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:38,983
好吧,好吧。我们在这里完成。
Okay, okay. We're done here.

613
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:42,963
你真以为他们能那么轻易地杀了我吗?
Did you really think they can kill me that easily?

614
01:12:53,946 --> 01:12:57,230
在我把剩下的吹走之前，他本来就没有什么脸蛋儿。
Before I blew the rest of it off he didn't have much of a face to begin with.

615
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:05,830
我留下了足够的自我让当局认为是我干的。
And I left just enough of me for the authorities to think it was me.

616
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,192
很抱歉是你发现了他。
I'm sorry you had to be the one who found him.

617
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,748
无论如何，你都可以随机应变。
You could always think on your feet anyway.

618
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,470
今晚没那么多。
Not so much tonight.

619
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,453
这就是朋友该做的，对吧?
That's what friends are for, right?

620
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,903
哦,很好。我们是朋友了。
Oh, good. We're friends again.

621
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:31,431
你跟人上床了，不是吗?
You got laid, didn't you?

622
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,903
越来越依赖这些东西来缓解压力。
Depending more and more on this shit to take the edge off.

623
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,830
计划是什么?
So, what's the plan?

624
01:13:58,796 --> 01:14:03,583
400英亩，要到那里你得徒步穿越12英里老鼠横行的丛林。
Four hundred acres, to get there you'd have to hike through 12 miles of rat-infested jungle.

625
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,200
只剩下河流，摄像头，声纳，巡逻艇。
That leaves the river, cameras, sonar, patrol boats.

626
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,462
还是个悲观的小混蛋，对吧?
Still a pessimistic little shit, aren't you?

627
01:14:09,885 --> 01:14:11,863
你还是一只杀不死的蟑螂。
And you're still a cockroach you can't kill.

628
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:13,870
我是指好的方面。
I mean it in a good way.

629
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:17,943
他们知道你要来。
They know you're coming.

630
01:14:18,582 --> 01:14:19,670
这是什么?
What is this?

631
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:23,750
这是避难室，在这里是避难掩体。
It's a panic room, in this case it's a panic bunker.

632
01:14:24,483 --> 01:14:26,880
如果他进去了，你就完了。
If he gets in there, you're done.

633
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:31,991
所有的客人都是乘船来的，他们上岸后将接受检查。
All the guests arrive by boat, they'll be screened a moment they disembark.

634
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:34,106
周边封锁，现场安全。
Perimeter locked down and site secured.

635
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:38,670
我还从以色列增加了一个16人的小队来过夜。
And I've added an additional team of 16 out of Israel just for the night.

636
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:40,628
看来你什么都准备好了。
Seems like you got everything covered.

637
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,874
迈克尔。
Michael.

638
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,156
想法吗?
Thoughts?

639
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:47,779
威尼斯。
Venice.

640
01:14:49,112 --> 01:14:50,730
每年的这个时候天气真的很好。
It's really nice this time of year.

641
01:14:51,024 --> 01:14:53,150
你应该去。现在。
You should go. Now.

642
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,411
这些人根本不知道自己在跟谁打交道。
These guys have no idea who they're dealing with.

643
01:15:32,217 --> 01:15:33,390
收到
Copy that.

644
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:56,791
你看起来有点紧张。
You look a little tense.

645
01:16:58,247 --> 01:17:01,590
从加冕的王子到贩毒集团的头头，我保护过所有人。
I've protected everyone from crowned princes to cartel kingpins.

646
01:17:02,224 --> 01:17:05,720
今晚不会有事的尤其是我们知道她长什么样之后。
Nothing's gonna happen tonight especially when we know what she looks like.

647
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:09,280
男孩……
Boy…

648
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:11,751
我真希望你提前拿到钱了。
I really hope you got paid upfront.

649
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:18,537
先生。
Sir.

650
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:43,710
什么吗?
Anything?

651
01:17:43,897 --> 01:17:46,510
目前没有；至今没有一，二，三区安全。
Nothing so far. Sectors one, two and three are clear.

652
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,710
我在等第四区的报告。
I'm waiting on the reports from sector four.

653
01:18:31,299 --> 01:18:32,293
谢谢你！
Thank you.

654
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:37,344
我怀着非常愉快的心情欢迎大家在这个非常昂贵的夜晚来到这里。
It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all here on this very expensive evening.

655
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:45,420
放眼望去，看到那么多熟悉的面孔、亲爱的朋友和亲密的生意伙伴，我那颗硬邦邦的心感到一阵暖意。
It warms my crusty heart to look across the room and see so many familiar faces, dear friends, and close business associates.

656
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:50,550
还有一些不熟悉的面孔，运气好的话，这些面孔不会持续太久。
As well as quite a few unfamiliar faces that with luck will not remain so for long.

657
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:55,200
也许我甚至发现了一些我以前的敌人。
Perhaps I may even have spotted a few former foes of mine.

658
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:00,581
我要特别感谢你们的到来，感谢你们认识到自己的错误。
I want especially to thank you for coming, and for seeing the error of your ways.

659
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:14,470
这么多年来，我很满意地认识到，没有什么比做好事更好的净化心灵的方式了，为他人做出无私的行为和善良的行为，
Over these considerable years, I've learnt to my great satisfaction there is no better way to cleanse the soul than to do good to perform selfless deeds and acts of kindness to sacrifice for others,

660
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:17,630
最重要的是慷慨地给予。
and most importantly to give generously.

661
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:27,650
正是由于你们的慷慨精神，我们才能够丰富和改善如此多的婴儿、儿童和急需照顾的青年男女的生活
It is due to your generous spirit that we've been able to enrich and enhance the lives of so many infants, children, young men and women in desperate need of care

662
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:31,920
如果没有你们每一个人，这是不可能实现的。
to a degree that would have been impossible to achieve without every one of you.

663
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:36,830
女士们先生们，感谢你们今晚的盛情款待。
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the privilege of being your host tonight.

664
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:44,543
感谢你允许我把手伸进你的口袋和钱包里，但这是有意义的。
And for allowing me to slide my hands into your pockets and purses, but for a worthy a cause.

665
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:48,590
圣奎特里亚修女的工作很出色…所以…
The sisters of St. Quiteria do outstanding work… So…

666
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,066
用心去付出。
…Give with your heart.

667
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:14,231
对于一个已经死了三十年的人来说，你看起来真不错，海耶斯先生。
You look really good for a man who's been dead thirty years, Mr. Hayes.

668
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,422
你怎么进来的?
How'd you get in here?

669
01:23:21,695 --> 01:23:25,230
技术。总有一天会毁了我们所有人。
Technology. It just gonna fuck us all one day.

670
01:23:26,511 --> 01:23:27,630
你是谁?
Who are you?

671
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:33,453
我是一只大坏狼，当地球上有人认为你的时间到了，我就会来抓你。
I'm the big bad wolf that comes to get you when someone on this Earth decides your time is up.

672
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,051
Moody。
Moody.

673
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,470
复活是个贱人，不是吗?
Resurrection is a bitch, ain't it?

674
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,183
你是来完成这项工作的，是吗?
You've come to finish the job, haven't you?

675
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:51,591
那么多年前你雇我来杀你，对吧?
Well, you did hire me all those years ago to kill you, right?

676
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,630
到底谁在那辆车里?
Who was really in that car?

677
01:24:03,984 --> 01:24:07,090
这有关系吗?可支配的资产。没有任何重要人物。
Does it matter? Disposable asset. No one of any consequence.

678
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:13,871
你看，我就指望像你这样的人说这种屁话。
You see, that's the kind of shit I expect someone like you to say.

679
01:24:15,391 --> 01:24:17,470
“没有什么重要人物。”
"No one of any consequence."

680
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:19,991
“像我这样的人”?
"Someone like me"?

681
01:24:20,487 --> 01:24:22,590
伙计，我在道德上不可能完全正确。
Man, I can't be all morally right.

682
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:26,191
我以杀人为生，坏人，提醒你，但是。
I kill people for a living, bad people, mind you, but still.

683
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:28,711
我从不假装自己是别的什么人。
I never pretend to be anything else.

684
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:33,960
你，你是众多知名慈善事业的核心人物。
You, you're front and center of a dozen high-profile charitable causes.

685
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,838
全世界都把你看得清清楚楚。
The world sees you as clean as first fucking snow.

686
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,920
但你手上都是屎。
But your hands are covered in shit.

687
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:47,177
血，从沙林毒气到人口贩卖的一切。
Blood, everything from sarin gas to human trafficking.

688
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:51,750
所以你知道我为什么要安排自己的死亡。
So you know why I had to arrange my demise.

689
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:02,271
我有了一个儿子，在很多方面都出乎意料。
I had a son, unexpected in many ways.

690
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:11,751
但我无法理解的是我对这个孩子的爱有多深，这个不完美的，完美的，脆弱的男孩。
But what I couldn't fathom was the depths of love I had for this child, this imperfect, wonderful, vulnerable boy.

691
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:16,610
如果我死了，卢卡斯就不会受到任何威胁或伤害。
If I were dead, Lucas would be free from any threats or harm.

692
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:17,991
废话。
Bullshit.

693
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:26,020
你也许爱你的儿子，海耶斯先生，但那是你消失的机会。
You may love your son, Mr. Hayes, but that was your chance to disappear.

694
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:31,110
你很精明的。
You're very astute.

695
01:25:31,831 --> 01:25:33,591
没人会去找死人。
No one looks for a dead man.

696
01:25:34,582 --> 01:25:40,480
我能够在体面的外衣下继续下去，这让我能够……变成一个更大的怪物。
I was able to continue behind the shroud of respectability that allowed me to... To become a bigger monster.

697
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:48,510
讽刺的是，海耶斯先生，我只是想向你儿子赔罪因为我把他的父亲从他身边带走了。
The irony of all of this, Mr. Hayes, is that I was just trying to make amends to your son for taking his father away from him.

698
01:25:50,690 --> 01:25:52,570
这一切都是你自找的。
You brought all of this on yourself.

699
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,093
安娜。
Anna.

700
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:24,231
你看起来不太好。
You don't look so good.

701
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,580
我不知道。
I don't know.

702
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,104
一杯苹果马提尼和一升AB阳性血就没事了，对吧?
Nothing an Apple Martini and a liter of AB positive won't fix, huh?

703
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:35,231
你觉得我有多大机会得到这些?
Hey, what do you think the chances are of me getting either?

704
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:36,632
晕倒。
Faint.

705
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:43,904
一些有趣的东西吗?
Something funny?

706
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,703
我觉得很有趣，你觉得自己比我强。
I find it amusing you think you're better than me.

707
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:49,702
而不是更好。
Not better.

708
01:26:50,765 --> 01:26:51,626
不同。
Different.

709
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,735
大多数人都是好人，海耶斯先生。
You see, most people are good, Mr. Hayes.

710
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:04,751
偶尔他们会做一些明知是坏事的事。
Then occasionally they do something they know is bad.

711
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:09,503
有些人很坏，他们每天都在努力控制自己。
Some people are bad, and they struggle every day to keep it under control.

712
01:27:10,015 --> 01:27:14,870
有些人腐败到极点，一点也不在乎，那就是我。
Others… corrupt to the core and just don't give a damn, that would be me.

713
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:17,031
但是邪恶……
But evil…

714
01:27:20,431 --> 01:27:24,511
邪恶是完全不同的生物，海斯先生。
Evil is a completely different creature, Mr. Hayes.

715
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:31,270
邪恶认为邪恶是好的，它的行为是正当的。
Evil believes bad is okay, its actions are justified.

716
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:37,791
脱离良心的暴力，不管付出什么代价，也不管对谁造成什么伤害。
Violence divorced from conscience, no matter what toll it takes or who it takes it upon.

717
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:42,951
朋友，这就是我们分道扬镳的地方。
And there, my friend, is where we part ways.

718
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:48,591
我只是个想为自己的罪行付出代价的坏人。
I'm just a bad man who's looking to pay for his sins.

719
01:27:50,647 --> 01:27:51,670
我明白了。
I see.

720
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:56,071
所以你是来问心无愧的吗?
So you are here to clear your conscience first?

721
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:08,580
你不可能活着离开这里。
You'll never get out of here alive.

722
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,360
我从没想过。
I never intended to.

723
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,780
还有一件事。
One more thing.

724
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,060
你差点杀了那个老人。
You could have killed the old man.

725
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:24,640
你为什么不?
Why didn't you?

726
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,744
计划不是这样的。
That wasn't the plan.

727
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:18,120
安娜:太棒了。位置
ANNA: IT'S BEEN A BLAST. LOCATION

728
01:29:51,752 --> 01:29:52,758
别管我!
Leave me alone!

729
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:56,791
不!不!
No! No!

730
01:30:01,158 --> 01:30:03,903
不!妈妈!
No! Mom!

731
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:20,490
妈妈!
Mom!

732
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:30,191
你怎么了?
What took you?

733
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:31,950
只是出去吃点东西。
Just out for a bite.

734
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:41,850
你就站在那儿?
You just gonna stand there?

735
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,617
现在。
For now.

736
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:50,231
没必要这样，安娜。
It doesn't have to be this way, Anna.

737
01:34:51,295 --> 01:34:52,293
不了。
Not anymore.

738
01:34:54,019 --> 01:34:56,434
我们最终都要为自己的罪孽付出代价。
We all have to pay for our sins eventually.

739
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,951
不必非得是今天。
Doesn't have to be today.

740
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:01,150
我累了。
I'm tired.

741
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:03,775
我想要和平。
I want peace.

742
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:06,739
你不在的时候，我不能把它拿走。
And I can't have it while you're out there.

743
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,671
如果我说你可以呢?
What if I told you you could?

744
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:13,490
是吗?
Yeah?

745
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:17,831
脑袋后面挨两枪，然后去吃个三明治。
Two in the back of the head, and then go have a sandwich.

746
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:26,080
你无法买回你的过去，安娜，你无法改变你的出身，但你可以改变你的未来。
You can't buy back your past, Anna, can't change where you came from, but you can change where you're going.

747
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,247
那会在哪？
Where would that be?
