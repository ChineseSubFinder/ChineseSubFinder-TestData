他是我见过最无情 最自私的人
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person I've ever met

我是绝对不会碰他的
I would never touch him

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,260
我和你说过我不想发生婚前性行为的吧
I told you I won't have sex before I get married, right?

精神病
Psychopath?

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,480
告诉我你没有和我哥上床
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,080
我不知道
I don't know

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,530
你没和尼克上床
You didn't sleep with Nico

16
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,160
但他拍了我的照片 裸照
But he took pictures of me.Naked pictures

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,160
我告了他
I reported him

因为你哥哥卑鄙 你就要跑去伦敦当混蛋吗
you gonna go around London being an asshole because ur brother is mean

26
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,300

What's wrong?

我需要点空间 好吗
I need some space, okay?

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,300
你不需要
You don't need space

36
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,040
我认真的
Dead serious

37
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,440
我尊重你
I respect you

38
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,740
现在你要尊重我
Now you have to respect me

我十三岁的时候 和人上过床
I had...sex when I was thirteen

40
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:36,100
他和我发生关系之后态度就变得很差
And the guy I had sex with behaved really shitty afterwards

41
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,960
所以在春天的时候 也不全是因为那件事
So in the spring...It was not just because of that

42
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,420
有很多原因
Lots of stuff

43
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,560
但那以后我有点
But then I got kind of...

所以我可能只是
So I'm probably just...

害怕那样的事情会再度发生
Scared that something like that will happen again

47

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,860
我真的非常抱歉
I'm really damn sorry

49
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,180
尼克做了那样的事
For what Nico has done

50
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,780
但那不是你的错
But it wasn't your fault

51
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,460
没发生什么严重的事情 而且他会被判罪的
Nothing serious happened, and he'll be convicted

52
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,000
不是很好吗
Isn't that good?

53
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,080
挪威有法律制度
We have a legal system in Norway

54
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,920
我们只需要相信法律是公正的
We just have to trust that the legal system is fair

55
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,020
所以你不用去杀他
So you don't have to kill him

56
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,160
你没有杀了他 对吧
You didn't kill him, did you?

57
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
我还没有见过他
I haven't seen him

我去伦敦了
I went to London

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
他在奥斯陆吗
Is he in Oslo?

60
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,060
不知道
Don't know

61
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,480
我还没有回过家
I haven't been to the apartment

62
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,400
这段时间住在我们公寓地下室的人是你吗
Is it you who has been living in our basement?

63
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,800
确实有人住在这里的地下室
There really is someone who's living in our basement

我住在克里斯家 之后也会继续住在他那的
I stayed with Chris.I'll continue to stay with Chris

67
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,740
你也可以住在这里
You can live here, too

68
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,940
但是你偶尔
But you have to

69
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,060
也得回家一趟
Go back to the apartment sometime

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,340
-你不想在这儿待一会吗   -为什么
- Don't you want to be here for a while?   - Why should I?

你现在可以逃避 但你不能躲你哥一辈子
You need to give in now.You can't run from ur brother rest of your life

83
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,940
你必须面对他
You just have to face him

84
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,000
你必须直视他 并且告诉他 他是个彻头彻尾的失败者
You have to look him in the eye and tell him he's a fucking loser

85
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,180
结束这一切
Be done with it

86

事情没有那么简单
That's not how it works

87
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,180
如果我现在见到他 我不知道自己会做出什么事
I don't know what I would have done if I had met him now

88
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,140
你要搬去哪儿
Where will you move to?

89
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,440
我会再买一间新的公寓
I'll buy a new apartment

90
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
你有钱吗
You have money for that?

91
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,980
我会搞定的
It'll work itself out

92
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,080
所以你的解决办法就是买一套新房子
So your solution is to buy a new apartment?

93
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
嗯
Yes

94

107
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,360
因为我用瓶子砸了那家伙的脑袋 有人录了视频

110
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,780
你有收到警方的通知吗
Have you received a letter from the police?

111
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,480
没有
No

112
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
你们收到了吗
Have you?

113
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,460
我们被传唤询问巴士派对那天晚上打架的情况
We've been summoned for questioning about the fight

114
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,220
他们还通知了我们的父母
on the night of the bus party.They called our parents

115
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,380
-我妈训我了  -我也被训了
- Mom snapped completely  - Mine too

116
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,860
为什么我没被传唤
Why was I not summoned?

117
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,940
可能因为你在警察来之前就走了 他们记下了我们的名字
Probably because you left before the police arrived.They took our names

118
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,460
又碰巧在网上看到了那个视频
They came across the video on the internet.

119
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,660
就开始调查这件事
The police has reported the case themselves

120
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,140
但你没有被传唤是件好事
But it's good that you weren't summoned

121
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,180
这样你就不用出面指证威廉了
It prevents you from having to testify against William

122
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,420
你们会指证他吗
Will you guys testify against William?

123
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,920
我们能怎么办 我们不能对警察说谎啊
What should we do? We can't lie to the police

124
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,060
我们可以拒绝回答
We can refuse to say anything

125
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
对 我们有权保持沉默
Yeah, we have the right to remain silent

126
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,020
反正他们不能只凭那个视频就给威廉定罪
They can't convict him based on just that video anyway

127
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,020
那个视频像素低 也没对好焦
The quality is bad and it's unfocused

128
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,060
我们必须想清楚
We really have to think this through carefully

129
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,240
他可能因为这件事坐六个月的牢 我查过的
He could go to prison for six months.I googled it

130
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,020
这件事是由威廉做的好事引起的
This all started when William did something good

131
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,160
怎么回事
How so?

132
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,100
冬天的时候 威廉打了一个
In the winter William beat up a Yakuza guy

133
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,290
骂克里斯前女友伊本贱婊子的小混混
for calling Iben, Chris' ex-girlfiriend, a cheap whore

134
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,180
为了报复 那个小混混打了入侵者的三个人
To avenge himself he beat up three Penetrator guys

135
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,260
威廉什么也没干
And William did nothing

136
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,260
他们打了约纳斯
They beat up Jonas

137
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,040
所以克里斯和伊萨克准备在巴士派对那天晚上教训那些人
Chris and Isak planned to beat up Yakuza on the night of the bus party

138
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,360
威廉毫不知情
William didn't know anything about it

139
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,680
但最终却要他为此负责
But he ended up having to take it

140
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,280
我们不能把故事经过告诉警察吗
Can't we tell them this story?

141
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,220
我认为这样做没有用
I don't think that's how it works

142
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,640
他们只关心是谁拿瓶子砸了别人的头
They're only interested in who threw the bottle at someone's head

143
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,220
威廉为什么要用瓶子砸人 娜拉
Why did William smash that bottle, Noora?

144
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,660
-为什么   -嗯
- Why?   - Yes

145
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,520
他觉得那个混混打了他的好朋友
He smashed it because he felt it was his fault

146
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:52,080
是因为他的错
That Yakuza beat up his best friend

147
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,820
他对他爱的人非常忠诚
He's extremely loyal to the ones he loves

148
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,180
所以他才这样做
So he did it because

149
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,860
他不想让大人承担责任
He doesn't entrust this responsibility with adult people, because

150
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,520
毕竟从来没有为他负责任的大人
There has never been an adult who has taken responsibility of him

151
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,760
而且他不能很好地控制自己的情绪
He also has a little trouble controlling his mind

152
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,600
如果你们能这么说就好了
It'd be great if you said that, too

153
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,980
审讯的时候我们就保持沉默吧
I say we shut our mouths at the questioning

154
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240

I agree

Okay, let's do it

Do you think Isak and Jonas will say anything?

157
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,300
不会 是威廉帮了他们
No, it was William who helped them

158
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,240
而且约纳斯讨厌警察
Jonas doesn't even like the police

159
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,720
唯一会毁掉一切的就是那些混混出来指证他
