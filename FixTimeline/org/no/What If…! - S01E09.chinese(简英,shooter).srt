时间

空间
Space.

3
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,208
现实
Reality.

4
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,125
它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

5
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:04,458
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility,

6
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,541
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

7
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,041
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界
creating alternate worlds from the ones you know.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,291
我是观察者
I am the Watcher.

9
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,958
我将带领你们穿越这些新现实

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,708
跟随我来  并思考这个问题
Follow me and ponder the question...

11
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,291
假如
第一季 第九集
季末大结局

12
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,333
"假如"呢
"What if?"

13
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,375
雷姆利亚星号
The Lemurian Star.

14
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,166
当海盗登上这艘船时  他们在发送最后的货物
They were sending their last payload when pirates took the ship.

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,416
-有多少海盗呢
-由巴作克领导的约二十名雇佣兵
-How many pirates?
-Twenty or so charmers led by Batroc.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,541
法国特种部队革退他之前
Before French special forces showed him the door,

17
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,333
他完成过36次杀戮行动
he racked up 36 kill missions.

18
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,166
嗯  听起来更吸引你啊
Hmm. Sounds more like your type.

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,916
好吧  我有"盾"  你有"剑"
Fine. I've got the shield. You've got the sword.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,166
是"刀"吧  这文字游戏真好玩
More like knives, but cute wordplay.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,750
关掉引擎  找出人质  各位小心了
Kill the engines and find the hostages. Gentlemen, watch our six.

22
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,791
特击小队  听好队长的命令  整装出发
STRIKE Team, you heard the captain, gear up.

23
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,666
所以  星期六晚有什么计划吗
So, any plans for Saturday night?

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,416
没有  不要  够了
No, don't. Stop right there.

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,625
会计部的伯纳德有在打听你
Bernard in accounting was asking about you.

26
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,625
"会计部的伯纳德"这句之后都没好事发生
Nothing good has ever followed the phrase, "Bernard in accounting."

27
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,375
假如他的名字是史蒂夫呢
What if his name was Steve?

28
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,000
哎唷  寡妇啊  只在我们成为好兄弟时
Ouch! Just when we were becoming pals, Widow.

29
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,541
我以为你不仅只是一块盾牌
I thought you were more than just a shield.

30
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,625
我也是个相当不错的舞蹈家呢
I'm a pretty good dancer, too.

31
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,041
我太快了
I'm too fast.

32
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,375
喔  那很好
Oh! That was good.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,458
-哇  -什么  你怕了吗
-Whoa! -What? Are you scared?

34
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,708
你看到了吗
Are you seeing that?

35
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:27,250
卡特队长  迷失在时间的战士  你已被选中了
Captain Carter, the soldier lost in time, you have been chosen.

36
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,583
哦  放马过来  放松吧  儿子
Oh, come on. Relax, son.

37
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,041
一千年后一切都将结束
It'll all be over in a thousand years or so.

38
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,041
嗯
Huh?

39
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,708
嘿
Hey.

40
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,041
留在这里  将这场战斗留给我们
Stay here. Leave this fight to us.

41
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:52,041
我知道了  是啊  和那穿斗篷的巨大男婴回来
I got it. Yeah. Hang back with the giant baby-man cape dude.

43
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,750
你已被选中了
you have been chosen.

44
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,041
这些无限宝石
These Infinity Stones...

45
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,375
我已不做武器买卖  不是我的菜
I'm out of the weapons business, not my cake.

46
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,375
但我们如何让一套铁甲遍布全球  嗯
But how do we put a suit of armor around the world? Hmm?

47
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,666
遍布银河
Around the galaxy?

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,916
你不能告诉我没有另一个又大又坏
You can't tell me there's not another big, bad

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,875
潜伏在床底黑影中的怪物
lurking-in-the-shadows monster under the bed.

50
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,416
托尼
Tony!

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,791
葛摩?  斯卡星的幸存者和灭霸的毁灭者
Gamora, survivor of Sakaar and destroyer of Thanos...

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,291
还是一个将要踢你这个丑八怪的人
And one who's about to kick your moon-shaped, ugly mug.

53
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,500
不是你啊  史塔克  葛摩?你已被选中了
Not you, Stark. You, Gamora, have been chosen.

54
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,208
克尔芒戈必需按瓦坎达的法律以谋杀罪受审
Killmonger must be tried for murder under Wakandan law.

55
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,791
我们了结后  美国人可以逮捕他
The Americans can have him after we're finished.

56
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,250
埃里克·史蒂文斯  克尔芒戈
Erik Stevens, Killmonger,

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:52,083
托尼·斯塔克的前门徒和杀手

We were about to go on a date!

00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,916
那里会有花  我会点蜡烛
There were gonna be flowers, and I was gonna light candles,

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,458
我要去洗澡和造好发型

66
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,583
你已被选

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,666
-你也是啊  -托尔  托尔

68
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,208
-还有你  还有你  -安静  冷静一下

69
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,833
托尔  奥丁的儿子  阿斯加德的王子
Thor Odinson, Crown Prince of Asgard...

70
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,291
你已被选中了
You've been chosen.

71
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,875
哦  我们在酒吧
Oh, we're in a pub.

72
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,625
我知道这个地方
I know this place.

73
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,750
这酒吧门面是我的主意
The pub facade was my idea.

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,625
我在你的传记中读过它  我希望你会喜欢
I read about it in your biography. I hope you like it.

75
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,833
这边  我  我  我可以喝杯啤酒
Over here. Me, me. Can I get a beer?

76
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,375
好
Yes!

77
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,041
-呃  你是谁  -我在哪里

78
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,583
你为什么带我们来这里  你要我们做什么
Why did you bring us here? What do you want with us?

79
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,041
都问得好
All good questions.

80
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,916
送我们回去  即刻
Send me back. Now.

81
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,416
-又是你  -老天鹅啊  用新花招吧  大佬
-It's you again. -Come on. Get a new trick, man.

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
你们已被选中
You have been chosen...

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,958
为了你们所认知的续命而执行
for a mission that is both highly dangerous and absolutely necessary

84
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,000
一项高度危险但绝对必要的任务
for the continuation of life as you know it.

85
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,625
最初  我在永恒中寻找一位真英雄
At first, I scoured eternity for one true hero.

86
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,541
然后我看到了更大的局面
Then I saw the bigger picture.

87
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,791
这任务需要一个团队
This mission requires a team.

88
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,916
只有这种技能和经验的完美结合才能致胜
The perfect combination of skills and experience that alone will triumph.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,083
我开门见山吧
Let me get this straight.

90
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:40,083
你跨越银河系绑架了我们  所以我们可以什么
You kidnapped us from across the galaxy so we could, what?

91
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,375
拯救全宇宙吗
Save the universe?

92
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,875
嗯  不太正确
Mmm. Not exactly.

93
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,583
更复杂一点
Bit more complicated than that.

94
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,666
你们不只是拯救一个宇宙的最大希望
You aren't just our best hope to save one universe.

95
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,791
你们是拯救全部宇宙的最后希望
You are my last hope to save all of them.

96
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,375
你们是多元宇宙守护队
You are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

97
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,291
我知道这是什么  是洛基让你搞这个笑话
I know what this is. Loki put you up to this joke.

98
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,833
听好了  今天我没有时间恶搞
Listen, I do not have time for his pranks today.

99
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,083
不  我不会那样做
No, I wouldn't do that.

100
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,791
我的简小姐需要我  所以我要走了  好好享
My lady Jane needs me. So, I'll be going. Enjoy yourse...

101
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,625
我们加入了  介意告诉我们我们的对手是什么吗
We're in. Mind telling us what we're up against?

102
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,125
你的世界正在或快将被奥创攻击
Your worlds are either under attack or soon will be by Ultron,

103
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,041
奥创是一种由增强的合成体和无限宝石的力量升华
an artificial intelligence elevated to a cosmic being

104
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,000
而成为宇宙存在的人工智能
thanks to an enhanced synthetic body and the power of the Infinity Stones.

105
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,541
六块拥有近乎无限力量的宝石
Six stones of near unfathomable power.

106
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,708
每一块都控制着一个我们存在的必要本质
Each controlling an essential aspect of our existence.

107
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,083
而奥创已手握所有
And Ultron holds all of them.

108
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,375
我或者能帮忙  我从更坏的人手上偷过更多
I might be able to help with that. I've stolen more from worse.

109
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
认真的吗  你真的来自另一个星球
Seriously? You really are from another planet.

110
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:48,083
我们相信阻止奥创的唯一方法是将他的身体与宝石分开
We believe the only way to stop Ultron is to separate his body from the stones.

111
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,375
但这奥创可能隐藏在多元宇宙的任何地方吧
But this Ultron could be hiding anywhere in the Multiverse?

112
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,041
-是的  -在杀戮机械人军团的背后吗
-Yes. -Behind an army of killer robots?

113
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,791
-恐怕如此  -带着整套宝石吗
-Afraid so. -And armed with a full set of stones?

114
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,208
-她说中痛点  -我从没说过会很轻易
-She's got a point. -I never said it would be easy.

115
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,625
这是一个自杀式任务
This is a suicide mission.

116
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,708
嗯  对不起  是的
Um, excuse me, yeah.

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,625
有没有一个世界有跨维度的中餐料理送餐服务
Is there a universe of Chinese food that has alternate dimension delivery?

118
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,333
肚子打鼓愈来愈响
Tummy's getting rumbly.

119
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,000
你选了他们
You picked them.

120
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,500
好的  显然  第一步是找到他
Well, obviously the first step would be finding him.

121
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,083
好吧  我不是吹嘘自己
Well, I'm not one to brag,

122
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:18,208
但有人告诉我我擅长引起不必要的注意
but I've been told that I excel at attracting unwanted attention.

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,958
哦  那会派上用场的
Oh. That will come in handy.

124
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,708
我们回收宝石后  销毁它们
And after we recover the stones, we destroy them.

125
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,083
你会怎样摧毁那
How would you even go about destroying the...

126
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,333
哦  你在回答我的问题  对不起  谢谢你
Oh, you're answering my question. Sorry. Thank you.

127
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,916
无限破碎机
The Infinity Crusher,

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,958
设计来分解每块宝石成虚无
designed to disintegrate each stone into nothing.

129
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,125
是的  我选了他们
Yep. I picked them.

130
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,875
好吧  各位  你们都知道要做什么  知道计划
All right, everyone, you all know what to do. You know the plan.

131
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,791
夺得灵魂宝石  交给葛摩?
Get the Soul Stone and get it to Gamora.

132
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,500
我们守卫防线  她会释放破碎机
We'll hold the line. And then she'll unleash the Crusher.

133
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,416
加点运气  我们将回家吃饭
With some luck, we'll be home for dinner.

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,083
好吧  等等  放慢一点
Okay, wait. Slow down a little bit.

135
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,458
房间里有几个人不明白
There's a few people in the room that don't understand.

136
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,208
不是我  我明白  但他们  或得重覆一次
Not me. I get it. But for them, maybe repeat it.

137
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,288
嗯  你们准备就绪
Hmm. You're ready.

138
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,541
我的朋友们  好戏开场了  祝你们好运
It's showtime, my friends. Good luck.

139
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,916
这个地方安全吗
This place is safe?

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,666
显然  这里没有足够的智慧生物来吸引奥创
Apparently, there's not enough intelligent life here to attract Ultron.

141
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,333
直到我们决定
Until we decide to.

142
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,083
我问问  发生过什么事
Can I ask, what happened?

143
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,958
发生在你身上一样的事啊  老友
Same thing that happened to you. Love.

144
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,375
我猜你知道你所在宇宙的卡特队长吧
I take it you know the Captain Carter on your universe?

145
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,708
并不  美国队长
No. Captain America.

146
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,708
在我的宇宙里  是史蒂夫·罗杰斯接受了血清
In my universe, Steve Rogers received the serum.

147
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,166
现在  那将是一个风景
Now, that would be a sight to see.

148
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,833
你信任他吗
You trust him?

149
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,166
我相信所有人
I trust everyone.

150
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,250
快点  朋友们  今晚我们享受盛宴
Hasten, friends. Tonight we feast.

151
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,250
为了明天  我们战斗
For tomorrow, we fight.

152
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,500
本着这种精神  我提议干杯
In that spirit, I propose a toast.

153
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,625
-一些蜂蜜酒  太好了  -哦  我们在说话
-Some mead. Wonderful. -Ooh. Now we're talking.

154
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:07,208
一位聪明的法师告诉过我  面对死亡是计划的一部分
A wise sorcerer once told me that to face death is part of the plan.

155
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:12,125
面对死亡  是为了克服对虚无的空间
To face death is to conquer one's greatest fear of the unknown

156
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:16,875
对一切终结的未知的最大恐惧
of nothingless space, of the end of all ends.

157
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,958
毫无意义的虚无和无限向你敞开的
The senseless nothing and the vast opening of infinity to your...

158
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,083
我来  够了  医生
Let me. You've done enough, Doctor.

159
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,625
敬多元宇宙
To the Guardians of...

160
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,458
守护队
The Multiverse.

161
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,000
多元宇宙
The Multiverse!

162
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:43,000
毕竟  这个宇宙有生命
So there is life in this universe, after all.

163
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,833
一直等我们准备就绪
There goes waiting until we're ready.

164
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,750
我自辩一下  我警告过你
In my defense, I did warn you.

165
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,458
我擅长吸引不必要的注意力
I excel at attracting unwanted attention.

166
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,416
嗯嗯
Mmm-hmm.

167
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,708
好吧  这是一个不合规的咒语
All right, here comes a non-compliant spell.

168
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,000
是的  你可能会感觉到
Yeah, you might feel it.

169
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,625
哇
Whoo!

170
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,625
-哦  发生什么事  -这是一个保护咒语  不用谢
-Oh, what is going on? -It's a protection spell. You're welcome.

171
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:16,666
哇  太棒了  好戏上演  观察者
Wow! This is fantastic. Showtime. Watcher!

172
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,833
另一边见
See you on the flip side.

173
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,583
我知道如何应付这扫兴鬼
I know how to deal with this party pooper.

174
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,750
等等  托尔  计划啊
Wait! Thor, the plan.

175
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,041
拉斯维加斯万岁
Viva Las Vegas!

176
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,208
什么
What?

177
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,791
不能说我以前听过战斗的呐喊
Can't say I've heard that battle cry before.

178
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,541
一切都很简单
All too easy.

179
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,875
有趣
Interesting.

180
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,250
通常  你们这些人更容易被杀死
Usually, you people are much easier to kill.

181
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,333
老天鹅 连刮痕都没有
Blimey! Not even a scratch.

182
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,291
你的保护咒并非开玩笑
You weren't kidding about a protection spell.

183
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,125
你受到保护  但不会持续太久
You're protected, but it won't last long.

184
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,458
哇哦
Whoo!

185
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,166
-我们出手了  你确定吗  -当然不
-We're up. Are you sure about this? -Of course not.

186
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,083
我们来了  就是现在
Here we go. Now!

187
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,000
哈
Ha!

188
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,875
-你中招了  -滚
-Gotcha. -Get off!

189
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,833
你明白吗
Did you get it?

190
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,458
正如勇度所说  "永远别怀疑黏手指"
As Yondu says, "Never doubt sticky fingers."

191
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,041
冲啊  冲啊
Go! Go!

192
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
什么  你一直在隐匿什么啊
What? You've been hiding that the entire time?

193
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,375
好的  这一定很快活
Well, this has been delightful.

194
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,208
但是时候拿出一些我自己的玩具
But it's time for me to bring out some of my own toys.

195
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,958
我的宝石  你们偷了我灵魂宝石吗
My stone. You stole my Soul Stone?

196
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,208
要走了
Time to go.

197
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,916
-那会让他很忙  -哦
-That'll keep him busy. -Oh!

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,041
僵尸  好主意  我爱?尸
Zombies! Great idea. I love zombies.

199
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,291
不是他们  是僵尸带来的东西
It's not them. It's what came with the zombies.

200
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,416
喔
Oh...

201
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,875
把握时间  朋友们
Tick tock, boys.

202
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,208
哇
Whoo!

203
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,375
那真出乎意料
That was unexpected.

204
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,833
什么
What?

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,791
该死的该死的胡说八道
Blimey bloody bollocks!

206
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,458
你成功了
Oh, you made it.

207
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,083
-你准备好了  -宝石呢
-You ready? -The stone?

208
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,916
停手  等等  退下
No, wait. Stand down.

209
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,166
-她是娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫  -谁啊
-She's Natasha Romanoff. -Who?

210
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,458
是的  我也应该是这个星球上的最后一人
Yeah. I'm also supposed to be the last person on this planet.

211
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,625
我们来自另一个宇宙  各个宇宙
We're from another universe. Universes.

212
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,666
我们是来阻止奥创的
We're here to stop Ultron.

213
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,166
我可以做证
I can prove it.

214
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,333
你父亲是伊万  你的丈夫是阿列克谢
Your father is Ivan. Your da's Alexei.

215
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:00,791
你是我那个与我并肩作战到现在也信任的女人  
And you're the one woman I trust to have my six, including now.

216
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,791
整个宇宙中你信任三个人
There are three people you trust in the universe,

217
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,541
我很庆幸能成为其中之一
and I count myself lucky enough to be one of them.

218
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,708
好吧  我们一定很亲密
Well, we must be close.

219
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,333
我相信"永远最好的朋友"
I believe the term is "BFF."

220
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,541
我相信你有属于我的东西
I believe that you have something that belongs to me.

221
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,000
娜塔莎
Natasha!

222
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,916
什
Wha...

223
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,750
我用一个念头就可以摧毁宇宙
I can destroy galaxies with a thought.

224
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,833
为什么你总是死不去
Why won't you die?

225
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,625
等等  什么
Wait. What?

226
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,458
用上你们所有的招数  别让他有机会思考
Give him all you've got. Don't give him a chance to think.

227
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,250
拉斯维加斯
Vegas!

228
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,750
你完了
You're done.

229
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,166
哇  呃
Whew! Uh...

230
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,458
-是吗  终于完了吗  -嗯
-Is that it? Is it over? -Hmm.

231
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,708
我们赢了吗  是吗  没那么难
We win? Yeah? Not so hard.

232
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,458
感觉还未完结
It doesn't feel over.

233
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,458
老实说  我很惊讶
I'm honestly surprised.

234
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,500
观察者没有警告过你们吗
Didn't the Watcher warn you?

235
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:03,958
每个宇宙都不同  每个宇宙都只有独一无二的部分
Every universe is different, each one just a fraction unique.

236
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,083
所以无限宝石是独一无二的
Thus the Infinity Stones are unique.

237
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,166
难怪啊
Of course.

238
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,416
破碎机是用来摧毁我宇宙上的无限宝石  不是他宇宙的
The Crusher was designed to destroy the stones on my world, not his.

239
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,208
振作准备
Brace yourselves.

240
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,291
你  是你啊
You. It's you.

241
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,541
如果我消灭你  你们全都会落败
If I destroy you, you all fall.

242
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,041
嘿  队长  我有个主意
Hey, Cap, I have an idea,

243
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,666
但我需要距离和明确的目标  你能做到吗
but I'll need distance and a clear target. Can you do that?

244
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,583
我有"盾牌"  你有"剑"
I've got the shield. You've got the sword.

245
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,458
更像是一支"箭"  箭尖是所有病毒之母
More like an arrow with the mother of all viruses in the tip,

246
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,583
但这文字游戏真好玩
but cute wordplay.

247
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,291
这是给你的  克林特
This one's for you, Clint.

248
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:20,625
这比我的人体要好多了
This is far nicer than my human body ever was.

249
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,166
谁在那里  谁说的
Who's there? Who said that?

250
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,916
这是一个引人入胜的变奏  对吧
This is a fascinating change of pace, yeah?

251
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,208
我已经很久没有双腿了
It has been a long time since I have had legs.

252
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,916
我想一直维持这个状态
I'd like to make this a permanent condition.

253
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,833
这个身体已被占用了
This body is occupied.

254
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,666
只是现在  但不会很久
For now, but not for long.

255
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,333
什么  你是谁  你有什么目的
What? Who are you? What is your objective?

256
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:46,666
曾几何时  它为了迎接九头蛇的统治
Once upon a time, it was to bring forth HYDRA's domination

257
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,583
但你终结了它
but you ended that.

258
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:54,250
所以现在  我想我要终结你
So now, I suppose my objective is to end you.

259
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,541
这是什么
What is this?

260
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,333
嘿  你没事吧
Hey, are you all right?

261
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,375
我很好  嗯嗯
I'm good. Mmm-hmm.

262
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,950
好的  那是  呃
Okay, that was, uh...

263
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,708
有人可以解释一下吗
Can someone explain, please?

264
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,916
我给他施打了病毒  很糟糕的一种
I gave him a virus. A nasty one.

265
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,541
堂哥  你在做什么呢
Cousin, what are you doing?

266
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,708
观察者欠我们的
The Watcher owes us this.

267
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,166
有了这些宝石  我们可以修复我们的宇宙  我们的生活
With these stones, we could fix our worlds, our lives.

268
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,541
特查拉  托尔
T'Challa, Thor,

269
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,916
你会放弃一件能拯救你们家园的物件吗
are you gonna turn down the one thing guaranteed to save your homes?

270
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,208
佩吉  你又可以和你的男朋友一起了
Peggy, you can be with your fella again.

271
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,625
斯特兰奇  你比谁都清楚  就是这样
Strange, you more than anyone know that this is it.

272
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,000
这是我们唯一的机会
This is our only chance.

273
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,833
把石头交出来  堂哥
Hand over the stones, cousin.

274
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,208
我不是你堂哥
I'm not your cousin.

275
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,958
我很抱歉要以这种方式结束
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

276
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:59,750
哦  不  不  不  恐怕那铁甲是属于我的
Oh, no, no, no. I am afraid that armor belongs to me.

277
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,291
是阿尼姆·左拉吗
Is that Arnim Zola?

278
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,875
九头蛇从未死亡  它只是变异了
HYDRA never died, it just mutated.

279
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,291
嗯  这就解释了肚上的面容
Well, that explains the stomach-face.

280
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,125
嗯
Huh?

281
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,083
我们从来没有打算赢
We were never meant to win.

282
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,208
我们来这里是为了将石头与身体分开
We were here to separate the stones from the body.

283
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,208
你预见过每一刻
You foresaw every moment

284
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:36,625
由无限粉碎机的失败  到克尔芒戈的背叛  以及我的
from the failed Infinity Crusher, to Killmonger's betrayal, and my...

285
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,750
你的牺牲
Your sacrifice.

286
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,750
"牺牲"
"Sacrifice"?

287
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:42,125
那意味着我有什么要失去的
That would imply I had something to lose.

288
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,500
需要有人照顾他们
Someone needs to attend to them.

289
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,125
如果那个口袋次元破裂  如果他们逃跑
If that pocket dimension cracks, if they escape...

290
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,416
我会观察
I'll watch.

291
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,583
除了时间  我什么都没有
I have nothing but time.

292

谢谢你  史蒂文斯
Thank you, Stephen.

293
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,666
嗯  此外  朋友有什么用呢
Mmm. And besides, what are friends for?

294
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,750
整个多元宇宙感谢你
The entire Multiverse owes you a debt of gratitude.

295
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,375
但是你们的世界永远不会知道这场胜利
But your worlds will never know this victory.

296
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,333
一旦你穿过那扇门
Once you walk through that door,

297
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,958
你们会回到离开的那一刻
you'll return to the exact moment you left.

298
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,708
是时候离开了  队长
It's time to go, Captain.

299
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,958
你宁愿回到另一个时间
You'd rather return to another time.

300
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,916
我不是已经赢得我的幸福结局吗
Haven't I earned my happy ending?

301
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:43,375
相信我  那个世界  那个时间
Trust me, that world, that time,

302
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:45,583
需要卡特队长
needs Captain Carter.

303
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,250
然后有一个宇宙
And then there was one.

304
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,050
我不会回去那里
I won't go back there.

305
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,750
我的宇宙已经
My world is...

306
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,708
消失了
gone.

307
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,791
你们赢了  但我输了
You won, but I lost.

308
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,583
-我不能干  -干预吗  是的  我知道
-I cannot in... -Interfere? Yeah, I know.

309
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:19,458
我们对你来说只是故事  我们不是真的
We're just stories to you. We're not real.

310
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,958
你看着我们战斗  胜利  失败
You watch us fight, win, lose.

311
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:25,666
告诉我  当奥创谋杀我的朋友并将我的世界夷为平地时
Tell me, did you make popcorn while Ultron murdered my friends

312
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,208
你有做爆谷吗
and burned my world to the ground?

313
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,500
对于我  你们不只是故事
You are more than that to me.

314
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,583
真的吗
Are we?

315
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:33,083
你们  你们的故事
You, your stories,

316
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,916
就是我的一切
they are everything to me.

317
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,916
那么修复我的世界
Then fix my world.

318
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,000
我不能啊  娜塔莎
I can't, Natasha.

319
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,250
我不会穿过那扇门
I'm not walking through that door.

320
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,500
好吧  无论如何  门更像是一个譬喻
Well, the door was more of a metaphor anyway.

321
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,625
哪里  我们在哪里
Where... Where are we?

322
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,375
在一个失去寡妇的宇宙中
On a world that lost their Widow.

323
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,000
一团糟
It's a mess.

324
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,708
谢谢你
Thank you.

325
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,666
嗯
Hmm.

326
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,708
你和你的复仇者后补们英勇奋战
You and your replacement Avengers fought valiantly,

327
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,583
但现在你是时候告诉我你所有的秘密了
but now I think it's time you told me all your secrets.

328
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,291
我被告知你已经死了
I was told you were dead.

329
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,208
彼此彼此
Same.

330
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,125
你不是我的娜塔莎
You're not my Natasha,

331
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:40,000
但我隐约知道你有她的灵魂
but something tells me you have her spirit.

332
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,833
就是这样  不是吗
That's it, isn't it?

333
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,000
所有的生物都在寻找一个属于自己的地方
All creatures searching for a place to belong.

334
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,291
一个家
To call home.

335
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,333
至于我  我是观察者
As for me, I am the Watcher.

336
00:29:55,916 --> 00:30:01,000
多元宇宙  每一个宇宙  每一个故事都是我的家
The Multiverse, every single world, every story is my home,

337
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:04,333
我会保护它到底
and I will protect it to the end.

338
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,041
我太快了
I'm too fast.

339
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,041
别告诉我  他吸引到你吗
Don't tell me, he was your type?

340
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,875
哦  寡妇  我从来没有这么高兴能见到你
Oh, Widow, I've never been so happy to see you.

341
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,041
你是撞坏了脑袋  还是怎样
Did you hit your head or something?

342
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,875
撞了几次  真的
A few times, actually.

343
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,875
算了吧  这行动需要清醒的理智
Shake it off. You'll need all your marbles for this one.

344
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,333
我发现了海盗们的目的
I found what the pirates were after.

345
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,375
佩吉  你可能要振作准备
Peggy, you might wanna brace yourself.

346
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,791
娜塔  我可以向你保证  
I can promise you, Nat,

347
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,291
这不会是我今天处理过最奇怪的事情
this won't be the strangest thing I've dealt with today.

348
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,291
继续吹
Famous last words.

349
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,000
九头蛇践踏者
The HYDRA Stomper?

350
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,500
是的  里面有人
Yeah, and there's someone inside.
