对不起，父亲。下次我会做到的。

真不敢相信我们居然没有她的照片。

115

别让她为此付出代价。
Don't make her pay for that.

 -伊拉克? -是的。

134
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,231
不光彩地从一场不光彩的战争中退伍。
Dishonorably discharged from a dishonorable war.

135
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:30,672
我想说这让我们很光荣。你不会吗？
I'd say that makes us honorable somehow. Wouldn't you?

136
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,072
不。
No.

137
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:37,044
你能把你的卡车挪开吗?
Can you move your truck off the road now?

138

当然,宝贝。
Sure, baby.

139

我明年想去上学。
I wanna go to school next year.

143
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,001
-这是学校……-一所真正的学校，

144
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,470

Homeschool is safer.

146
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,106
我不想要安全。
I don't wanna be safe.

我已经失去过一个女儿。
I already lost a daughter once.

151
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,053
我不会失去你的。
I'm not losing you.

152
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,789
但是我孤独。
But I'm lonely.

153
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:32,259
你根本不知道孤独是什么感觉。
You have no idea what it is to be alone.

154
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,530
你有我。
You have me.

155
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,001

00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,701
他怎么了?
What happened to him?

322
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,537
他罪有应得。
He got what he deserved.

323
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:28,709
嘿。我不后悔。
Hey. I'm not sorry.

324
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:30,745
你也不应该。
You shouldn't be either.

325
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:32,146
我想去。
I wanna go.

326
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:35,249
哪里?你要去哪里?
Where? Where you gonna go?

327
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:37,485
我知道有个避难所。
There's a shelter I know.

328
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,554
就像我说的,
Like I said,

329
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:42,490
你不再是囚犯了。
you're not a prisoner anymore.

他告诉你的一切都是谎言。

你……
You...

348
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,676

哦，宝贝，我们好想你。
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

355
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:24,111
嗯…
Mmm...

356
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:25,547
你看看。
There you are.

357
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,851
你是一个多么漂亮的孩子。
You were such a beautiful baby.

358
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:41,895
把它弄出来。
Get it out.

362
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,008
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

363
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:00,615
就是那场毁了我们家的大火……
The same fire that destroyed our family...

364
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,286
它烧坏了我的内部。
it burned up my insides.

365
01:03:09,857 --> 01:03:12,793
妈妈和爸爸曾经有一个…
Mom and Dad used to have a...

366
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,600
厨房，呵……
kitchen, heh...

367
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:20,735
在我们房子的地下室，
in the basement of our house,

368
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:23,772
我们过去常在那里做饭。
where we used to cook.

369
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:29,910
是为了我们的生意。
It was for our business.

370
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,684
你渴吗?
Are you thirsty?

371
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:51,566
泰拉?
Tara?

372
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:54,803
我要死了。
I'm dying.

373
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:56,036
什么?
What?

374
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:00,742
化学物质产生的烟雾…
The smoke from the chemicals...

375
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:04,546
毒死了我的血液，严重损坏了我的心脏。
poisoned my blood and badly damaged my heart.

376
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:07,515
我想我没有多少时间了。
I don't think I have much time left.

377
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,483
你能做点什么吗?
Is there anything you can do?

378
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:22,564
我听说你在我们的老房子里给我留了花。
I heard you left flowers for me at our old house.

379
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,334
是真的吗?
Is that true?

380
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:32,039
哦。
Oh.

381
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:34,709
你不是希望
Weren't you wishing

382
01:04:34,843 --> 01:04:39,748
你妈妈很健康还活着?
your mama was healthy and alive?

383
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,115
是的。
Yes.

384
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:56,564
我需要一个新的心脏，宝贝。
I need a new heart, baby.

385
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,868
但不是一般的心脏。
But not just any heart.

386
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,404
医生说一定是…
Doctor said it has to be a, uh...

387
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:05,472
那一定是…
It must be a...

388
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,743
兼容的捐献者。
compatible donor.

389
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,082
就像直系亲属一样。
Like a direct relative.

390
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:20,588
你拥有能救你妈妈一命的天赋。
You hold the gift that can save your mama's life.

391
01:05:24,893 --> 01:05:27,729
宝贝，我需要这份礼物。
And, baby, I need that gift.

392
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:49,818
我们最终会像一个人一样在一起。
We'll finally be together as one.

393
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:56,624
你会活在我身上。
You'll live on in me.

394
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:26,487
回家。
Go home.

395
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:22,036
离开。
Go away.

396
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:24,237
我说了，走吧。
I said, go.

397
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,480
留下来。
Stay.

398
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:37,919
留下来。
Stay.

399
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,385
回家。
Go home.

400
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,495
回家。
Go home.

401
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:03,871
我希望你能理解
I hope you understand

402
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,206
这个手术的高风险。
the high risks of this procedure.

403
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,209
我想我给你的钱够多了。
I think I pay you enough.

404
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:11,244
闭嘴，做好你的工作。
Shut up and do your job.

405
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:14,448
为什么她还活着?
Why is she still alive?

406
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,218
如果她死了，她的心脏也死了。
If she's dead, so is her heart.

407
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:21,556
而且我没法保持足够的新鲜感
And I can't keep it fresh long enough

408
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:24,826
没有合适的设备。
without the proper equipment.

409
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:27,895
我得在她还活着的时候把它取出来。
I have to cut it out of her while she's still breathing.

410
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:31,666
嘿。
Hey.

411
01:10:31,799 --> 01:10:33,266
嘿,嘿,嘿。
Hey, hey, hey.

412
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,203
嘿,嘿。
Hey, hey.

01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:39,874
谢谢你！
Thank you.

414
01:11:00,293 --> 01:11:02,295
你怎么了，伙计?
What's wrong with you, man?

415
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:05,800
他们在里面做的事是不对的。
What they're doing in there is wrong.

416
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,070
她是我们的厨师。
She's our cook.

417
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:13,508
如果她死了，就没有产品了。
If she dies, there's no product.

418
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:15,977
如果没有产品，就没有我们。
If there's no product, there's no us.

419
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:19,647
明白？
¿Comprende?

420
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,718
还是他妈的错了。
Still fucking wrong.

421
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:32,894
嘿。
Hey.

422
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:36,664
 -你准备好了吗? -嗯哼。
- You ready? - Mm-hm.

423
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:40,635
我们走吧。
Let's go.

424
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:05,827
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

425
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,333
去看看吧。
Go check it out.

426
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:26,113
嗯。
Hm.

427
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,580
你杀了我兄弟!
You killed my brother!

428
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:36,017
你这瞎眼怪物!
You blind freak!

429
01:13:58,372 --> 01:14:02,276
我要把你的脑袋像南瓜一样切开，伙计。
I'm gonna carve your fucking head open like a pumpkin, man.

430
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:00,601
这是为了影子。
This is for Shadow.

431
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:03,671
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

432
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:05,039
不!
No!

433
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:13,314
是他。
It's him.

434
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,821
他是怎么找到……？
How the hell did he find...?

435
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,475
不忠的该死的动物。
Disloyal fucking animal.

436
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:43,512
一切都好吗?
Is everything okay?

437
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,481
是的,一切都好。
Yeah, everything's okay.

438
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:50,551
-没事的，我保证。-宝贝，我该担心吗?
- Everything's okay, I promise. - Baby, should I be worried?

439
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,319
不，不。一点也不。
No, no. Not at all.

440
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:53,821
我抓到你了。我抓到你了。
I got you. I got you.

441
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,490
没有电我不能工作。
I can't work without power.

442
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:57,691
嗯…
Uh...

443
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:01,195
那么，计划有变。
Change of plans, then.

444
01:16:01,328 --> 01:16:03,197
收拾你的东西。带上女孩。
Pack your things. Bring the girl.

445
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,565
劳尔。
Raul.

446
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,768
带上男人。杀了那个瞎子。
Bring the men. Kill the blind man.

447
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:11,572
-我们多少人? -你们所有人!
- How many of us? - All of you!

448
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:15,609
我们走吧。
Let's go.

449
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:50,471
他们会杀了她。
They're gonna kill her.

450
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:56,677
这对我来说很不好。
And that's not cool with me.

451
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:01,715
他们要走了。
They're leaving now.

452
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,017
你身后的梯子
The ladder behind you

453
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:04,685
直接指向他们。
leads directly to them.

454
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,420
你最好快点。
You'd better hurry.

455
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:21,902
向左走。
Go left.

456
01:18:23,037 --> 01:18:24,305
那边。
That way.

457
01:18:27,676 --> 01:18:29,210
他会把你们都杀了。
He'll kill you all.

458
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:39,920
他妈的。我出去。
Fuck it. I'm out.

459
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:42,323
嘿,嘿!嘿!
Hey, hey! Hey!

460
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,517
早上好,草泥马。
Good morning, motherfucker.

461
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:16,591
 -宝贝。 -嘘,嘘。没关系。
- Baby. - Shh, shh. It's okay.

462
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:18,892
住手。
Stop it.

463
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:52,860
宝贝?
Baby?

464
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:55,496
有人吗?
Hello?

465
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,264
我看不见你。
I can't see you.

466
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:07,941
宝贝?
Baby?

467
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:42,644
我在这里!你在哪里?
I'm over here! Where are you?

468
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,279
宝贝?
Baby?

469
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:11,038
我抓住你了，混蛋。
I got you, motherfucker.

470
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:23,718
不。
No.

471
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:27,187
不!不!
No! No!

472
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,130
不。

473
01:21:37,832 --> 01:21:39,634
不!
No!

474
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,086
凤凰!
Phoenix!

475
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:08,255
现在…
Now...

476
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,290
你会看到
you're gonna see

477
01:23:10,424 --> 01:23:12,292
我所看到的。
what I see.

478
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:03,912
凤凰?
Phoenix?

479
01:24:14,488 --> 01:24:16,123
住手。
Stop.

480
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,892
哦，住手!
Oh, stop!

481
01:24:20,995 --> 01:24:22,362
你……
You...

482
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,901
